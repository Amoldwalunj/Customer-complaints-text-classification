It became clear based lack information wanted form seemed dead end. Since me, really going take consideration situation find solution make plan would need ask information asking for. After That I looked seemed saying might offer. To offering help help actually seems dangerous, anyone said would solving problem pushing line end much bigger problem ... They wanted put everyone applies 90 forbearance. And end forbearance would pay 3 months once. There mention fees interest would work, I think since 3 months interest tacked dramatically increase amount owe 90 days people aware may getting pretty bad deal. Here 's I think dangerous practice. 1. It solve problem, someone can't pay monthly 3 months rolls around going pay giant lump some. If happens bunch people going lead bunch foreclosures. 2. This allow someone actually plan, If I know much I'm going owe, Its hard responsibly plan make sure I pay. My bank basically saying well see 3 months.
