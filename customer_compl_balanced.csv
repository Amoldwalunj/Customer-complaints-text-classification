3,2020-04-03 00:00:00,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Problem with the interest rate,"To Whom It May Concern, As a borrower of Santander Consumer USA, I have reached out to the company with my concerns about the auto loan account that I have open with them. I have addressed the fact that I, as a low income borrower, was not aware of the 27.99 % APR on the auto loan, which exceeds California 's usury rate. In fact, they exceed the rate by 17 %. I've been a borrower of theirs for over two years and have not yet paid half to the principal, and have reached out to them with major issues to break down into detail about where my own money was going towards. I have politely asked for refinancing options as well, but was denied this. I have asked for Extended Payment Plan, which they had charged an additional 5 % without notifying me, and the representative over the phone never clarified to me. I have tried my best to keep up with the payments, but feel that I will need to reach out to those of higher authority to help alleviate some stress. My auto loan borrowed was initially {$12000.00} to finance for 60 months. Beginning XXXX of XXXX, I have only paid less than {$1000.00} towards principal which doesn't make any sense, for I've made payments on time prior to my recent financial struggles in the past year of XXXX. I've closed my credit accounts to pay for this auto loan that is clearly a depreciating asset, but none of my money has gone towards the principal of this car. I've kept in contact with Santander about my situation in hopes that our business could become better, but I honestly feel a deep disrespect from the lender as I've tried my best to be cordial. On XX/XX/XXXX on a Thursday evening, I've called to manage my past due balance to bring my account back to current, and was told by 2 separate representatives an amount of {$620.00} made before XX/XX/XXXX would bring my account back up to current. I was not told of any other late fees that would be charged onto my account. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I called to confirm this amount and was actually charged an additional {$260.00} onto my account, which was only three business days, and after speaking with a representative and a Supervisior who've clarified the additional charge. I asked to be waived of these extra charges because I was not given this information, and was again denied. If there is a reason for my default, I believe that Santander is in exploit of that. I am not satisfied as a consumer and would like to report this scandal. If Santander strives to be a company of prosperity and respect, they wouldn't dig a deeper threshold for their own consumers.

Within 2or 3 weeks the engine light came on, we took it in to be checked out by an outside auto shop and found out the problem was a bad engine that could not be fixed internal engine failure. {$11000.00} to replace then while they were finishing the inspection they said the 4 wheel drive system which is the  vtm was also going out along with the front and rear brakes that were so bad that we could have been in a very bad car accident, we were lucky that we took it in, and on top of that the cv joints and the struts were also shot bringing the total to about {$15000.00} dollars we contacted the dealer on XX/XX/122020 and they stated it was not there problem, they stated the car was sold as is.

The original financing was through NMAC ( Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp. ) I refinanced online through XXXX  XXXX. It appeared that all had gone well with XXXX XXXX notifying me that my loan was approved and the payoff was sent to NMAC. I paid my first payment with XXXX XXXX In XXXX. Prior to making that payment, I happened to check my NMAC account online to find that the my loan was showing that it was still active, and there was a large payment applied to the loan on XX/XX/XXXX, but it was not the full payoff amount. Further, it showed my monthly payment was increased from {$510.00} to over {$600.00} and the a payment was not due until the year XXXX! I knew something was wrong. I contacted NMAC and was told that XXXX XXXX did not send the correct payoff amount. The person also told me that they were unable to see where this partial payment came from which was unusual and he said that they would open an investigation on the account. He also said that if I could contact XXXX XXXX and try to get a copy of the payoff amount check and forward it to NMAC I then contacted XXXX  XXXX, where I was assured that the proper payoff amount was sent and to give NMAC some time to complete the investigation and if it didn't resolve to call back. Well it didn't resolve, NMAC insists XXXX XXXX sent the wrong amount. So I provided NMAC with the USPS tracking number of the check that XXXX  XXXX sent and that shows it was received on XX/XX/XXXX. My NMAC account showed that a large payment of XXXX was made on XX/XX/XXXX so that makes no sense since the check didn't arrive until the following day. several phone calls between both lenders for the month of XXXX yielded no results. I have been the middle man in a clash of the titans here where I have no control nor access to any of the data that can prove anything. I finally got XXXX  XXXX to initiate a 3 way conference call with NMAC in early XXXX, where XXXX  XXXX stated that they would fax a copy of the check to NMAC to prove the full payoff was sent. NMAC stated it would take up to 21 days for ANOTHER investigation to be completed. So I called NMAC 21 days later to find again no progress, still saying it's XXXX XXXX 's fault. Back to XXXX XXXX, I now have a point of contact there, her name is XXXX. She contacted me right after XXXX, to update me that on there end it shows that NMAC never deposited the check even though someone signed for it, so NMAC lost it. The partial payment on my account was another error on NMAC and that they were going to remove that payment and that they working on getting the payoff finalized once again. 

Here 's the problem. I technically have 2 open loans on the same vehicle, I had been paying XXXX  XXXX for 3 months and on NMACs end it originally showed that I didn't have a payment due until XXXX. Now that that erroneous payment has been removed it now shows me 3 payments behind NMAC and when I try to call NMAC to speak with someone handling my case about the refinance fiasco I get dumped to collections automatically and all the want for me is to make payments. I am a XXXX, retired XXXX  injured in the the line of duty and I live on a fixed income and there is no way I can make 2 car payments on the same vehicle until these people figure all this out. 

Now I'm concerned that NMAC will be reporting these late payments to my credit report and I feel that this is unjust. They lost the payoff check, from what little info I'm provided it appears NMAC is at fault, yet I'm in the middle being torn apart.

In my soon to be XXXX  years on this planet, this has to be the most incompetence I've seen from a financial institution. XXXX XXXX I'm not happy with as well as they really take no responsibility to confirming that the institution being paid off has actually received, credited the proper payoff, and closed out the old loan before XXXX XXXX sends the consumer the refinance completion along with a first statement to be paid on the new loan I want this resolved.

60,1/28/2020,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"See XXXX-XXXX  - I need to ask you to open this again. 
Capital One questioned ( or implied ) that they never had received the {$650.00} from XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX  sent Cash Letter XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. This included the check in question, as well as the before and after items. 
This amount was listed as 'fully available ' in my account ( and per the Capital One statement ) on XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, Capital One issued a chargeback for {$650.00}, due to Endorsement Irregular. 
That means Capital One got the money, that it had cleared, and was fully available to me for a week. The fact that they then issued a chargeback further confirms they had the {$650.00}. 
The reason for reopening the case is that it has now shifted from Capital One arguing they never received the money to 'where did the money go '. On a chargeback, that money taken from my account must go somewhere. What's the paper trail at Capital One, starting on XX/XX/XXXX, showing the return of the money? Neither XXXX XXXX  nor the account the money was drawn on have any record of the {$650.00} being returned. ( Had it been properly returned, I would have been issued a new check, which I could then deposit again ). 
Here is the latest email exchange : XXXX - Well need to go through this again, as I simply dont believe you. 

1 ) Ive documented - and am doing so again - the fact that XXXX XXXX sent to Capital One Bank the {$650.00} in question and that it cleared on XX/XX/XXXX. See attached email from XXXX XXXX at XXXX. In case you dont understand the attachment, it shows directly that XXXX sent you the money. It lists the check sent to your bank, shows all the CL details, and confirms the RTN. ( And, as a matter of fact, the {$500.00} 'Item Before ' may also well be a deposit from me, as the {$650.00} was but XXXX of many checks I deposited to your Bank that same day ). 

2 ) I deposited said check on XX/XX/XXXX, and according you, the funds were Fully Available '' on XX/XX/XXXX. That means theyd cleared - the money transferred from XXXX on XXXX WAS IN MY ACCOUNT. ( In point of fact, if, say, I only then had had {$670.00} in my account, and had transferred that {$650.00} out on XX/XX/XXXX - Id have my money, and wed be having a different discussion, because the {$25.00} remaining certainly would not have covered the {$650.00} you backed out of my account on the XXXX ). Seeing how you operate, I doubt seriously that youd front me the money - despite the legality of having done so, and despite my very-long-term relationship with your Bank. That means you had my money in my account. 

3 ) NOTE THE ENDORSEMENT ON THE BACK OF THE ATTACHMENT 1470.pdf. Unless I need a new pair of glasses, that says Capital One, NA, with associated details, including your RTN. How is is possible that your check processing team cant find A CHECK ENDORSED BY YOUR BANK? 

You need to challenge your check processing team - again, and firmly - with the above facts and attachments. What say they to this evidence ( presented again ) that the funds were sent by XXXX to Capital One - AND CLEARED? 

Oh - and I also have an email from the Senior Account ( and CPA ) at the company who wrote the check to me in the first place. They show also that the funds cleared their account on XX/XX/XXXX, and dont see ANY refund of that money. From their seat, theyve paid me. The key point there, in case you missed it, is that THE FUNDS CLEARED THEIR ACCOUNT ON XX/XX/XXXX. 

Nobody has any evidence that the funds were returned to XXXX by Capital One. 

But - thats after the fact. The problem here is that your check processing department cant find the funds that were sent to you by XXXX, to begin with. Thats counter to the evidence above. 

Once they find this money, then Ill expect that the {$650.00} is restored to my account promptly ( plus interest - since you so kindly docked me {$0.00} interest on the XXXX ) ). 

How bout this, XXXX? Instead of you fronting for you check organization, find a senior check processing specialist from that part of your company, and set a call with you, me, and that person. Im certain I can get XXXX XXXX from XXXX to join that call. Have them explain to all of us why they cant find a cleared check endorsed by Capital One. 

XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX screen-shot of check : - Attachment below Cash Letter information, and confirmation of RTN : - Attachment below Capital One statement extract showing the {$650.00} deposit on XX/XX/XXXX, and the deposit reversal on XX/XX/XXXX. 
- Attachment below Details on the statement, expanding the check to show funds fully available on XX/XX/XXXX. 
- Attachment below XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX, XXXX wrote : Dear XXXX , First and foremost, were sorry for the inconvenience and the amount of time you spent speaking with us while trying to get this matter resolved. We agree the experience you had didnt live up to the standard Capital One strives for.

With that said, we worked closely with our check processing team who confirmed that we never received the funds from XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  as they did not pay the check due to an irregular endorsement.

Furthermore, I believe Credit Acceptance Corporation is structuring its loans in a way that constitutes unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, as the loans interest is above my state 's usury rate and is charged as an up-front fee, and therefore prepaying the loan does not result in a reduction of total interest charged.

The salesperson approved for {$1200.00} Cash Discount on the sales price + AN OPTIONAL Warranty Value Discount for {$2000.00}.

That shows the amount financed is {$17000.00}! What makes around {$6000.00} Difference. plus interest charges of this difference in % 9.99 interest rate for 72 months!!!

When I realized a few years ago I was not in procession of a title, I called Fifth Third Bank to ask about it. The notified me the release was sent to the DMV and I could request a duplicate title, so thats exactly what I did. In XX/XX/XXXX, I sent in the CA DMV form requesting a duplicate title along with the {$22.00} fee. CA DMV returned the form and check notifying me the lien had not been released by Fifth Third. 
I then called Fifth Third Bank notifying them of the problem, and they said the release was sent to Virginia, where the vehicle was previously registered from XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and to contact Virginia. I called the Virginia DMV, and they had no record of the release either. 

I became frustrated and let it go until early XX/XX/XXXX. I called Fifth Third Bank again, explained the prior scenarios and they said a state-to-state transfer from VA to CA must be completed with their third party title provider. I was transferred to this third party, and the third party notified me the release was sent to Connecticut where the vehicle was registered from date of purchase in XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX and to contact CT for the title. I then called the CT DMV ; they did not have record of the release either. After calling the CT DMV, I tried the VA DMV again to double check if they had record of anything, and still nothing. The VA DMV said they needed to receive a release from the bank to issue a title. I called Fifth Third Bank again, and a gentleman told me he would re-submit a release to VA and I should give it 10 business days to get a title from VA. I confirmed VA had my current address, but have not received the title as of today, XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called back Fifth Third bank XX/XX/XXXX where I explained the scenario and told them I just need a title from somewhere to sell my vehicle in the next 30 days. Fifth Third again referred me to their third party, the third party refereed me to CT, and back to Fifth Third again when I told them CT had no record of the release. I am going in circles with Fifth Third Bank.

To begin with, they sold me the 'wrong ' car. They filled out all the paperwork and went through the credit process and took my down payment, for the wrong car. They had me go through hours of hoops to now return this other car, so they may sell me the correct car. Not only did they tell me one price on the first set of paperwork, they came back with two different prices on th.e next set of paperwork. The amount changed several times over the course of the sale. Now, I have a higher interest rate, due to the fact I had an auto loan on my credit FOR A CAR I NEVER OWNED ( they one they sold me by mistake ) They also told me that the car I was purchasing had a clutch recall. After the sale was complete, their story changed, and they said the clutch was not under recall. I drove it off the lot and within days had to return it for the terrible alignment, and to have the off centered steering wheel - centered. The steering wheel was clearly offset / turned/set incorrectly, and the car was badly pulling to the left. The car also made a continuous burning rubber smell. They took it in and 'aligned ' it. The mechanic told my brother and me that the steering wheel just couldn't be centered on this vehicle due to something wrong with the front end, so it was offset to the left - whatever - i needed a vehicle. I drive it for about a week after that and notice that the headlights turn off / cut completely out when I roll/put the window down ( depressing the power window switch ). EVERY TIME I put the driver window down, the headlights went out. I called XXXX twice about this issue and the broken plastic pieces/arm rests, and door panels. NO ONE EVER CALLED ME BACK.

I had not accessed this savings account in a year, so no transactions should have been going through. I immediately went on-line and discovered that my savings account had been depleted. There were multiple XXXX XXXX transactions, from multiple businesses, ranging from {$11.00} to {$1900.00}, beginning XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, with a total of {$5800.00} stolen. All of the big transactions were debited between XXXX XXXX. I contacted Chase via phone and they told me the system was down and to call back the next day. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and a Chase rep stated she could help me with a manual dispute but I would need to go in person to sign the form. On XX/XX/XXXX i visited the XXXX, CA branch and sat down with a rep. She phoned the fraud department to have them send her the form and they stated to her that they would e-mail me something. She pushed the issue to receive the form for me to sign because she was familiar with the process, but again they said I would receive something via mail. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an e-mail to check my on-line banking for documents and there was nothing, so I called the Fraud Department. I spoke to XXXX, and she informed me that I would only be receiving credit of {$40.00}, which were for the transaction that posted XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. I then asked to speak to the manager of the Fraud Department, XXXX, and she informed me that this was the final decision. I personally, work for a financial institution, and this was odd to me since our bank issues credit for transactions within the last 60 days and they were issuing credit from months prior and not recent transactions. I decided to go into the XXXX branch to speak to the manager on XX/XX/XXXX to see if he could help me find a resolution. I spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and he was not much help. He spoke to the Fraud Department and they said that this was still an open case after they had told me it was already closed. Lots of confusion going on between manager and fraud department. They ended with saying that my case was bumped up to the Escalations Department and I would receive something in the mail. I checked my mail for the multiple days and nothing. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX XXXX directly and spoke to a rep, XXXX, about the fraud. She asked me if I knew a XXXX XXXX and I did not know anyone by that name. She confirmed that this person did commit fraud using my account and that she would hold the funds owed to me and shut down that account. XXXX stated that because the fraud was not linked to a checking account or debit card, Chase would need to manually retract the funds. After I hung up the phone, I immediately went to the XXXX branch and was helped by XXXX XXXX, since the manager was out of the office. She was the only person to show empathy for this situation. She contacted the Fraud Department, to explain that Pay Pal had the money and that Chase needed to retract the funds. The fraud rep escalated to a manager XXXX XXXX XXXX, who repeated what i already knew with the small credits being issued. Again, XXXX reiterated that Chase only needed to retract the funds. XXXX sent a Disputed Transactions Questionnaire form to XXXX via e-mail. She printed the form and we completed it. She faxed it back to XXXX. He said it may take some time to receive the credit. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an e-mail that there was documents for me to sign regarding my case in my on-line inbox but there was nothing there. I contacted XXXX again she advised that I go into the branch to figure out why I could not view documents on-line. On XX/XX/XXXX, I visited XXXX at the branch and she verified that I had no documents in my inbox. She contacted the Fraud Department and they e-mailed her that same dispute form that I already submitted the day prior. The Fraud Department then stated that they did get my form but had not reviewed it yet. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Pay Pal and spoke to a rep, XXXX, to see if Chase had tried pulling the funds. She said the funds were still on hold and there was no attempt from Chase yet. She provided me a case number. I have called to follow up with Chase on many occasions and have to re-explain my situation every time and there is no status update. On XX/XX/XXXX I was on the phone for 40 minutes with no answer. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX and he stated that the credits that i received of {$40.00} was all I was able to get. I explained my whole situation with XXXX XXXX having the funds and he said since it was passed 60 days that they could no longer retract from XXXX XXXX. I received an e-mail on XX/XX/XXXX that I received documents in my on-line inbox and nothing was there. At this point my level of frustration is beyond compare.

Since then, I've called 5 different times to get a Lien of Release, and each time they claim to send it, but it has NEVER arrived at my apartment ( I have a mailbox that locks, so it wasn't stolen ).

My  payments were submitted by XXXX XXXX accelerated program and were always submitted on time. They deducted from my bank account every two weeks a set and consistently throughout the year Occasionally there would be an extra amount in which XXXX XXXX would submit to PNC as a principal payment and noted as such on the manual check and mailed to pnc for posting. PNC applied most payments correctly but I did find a few that were not applied correctly and interest deducted from those payments. I started my inquiry when I requested my payoff amount. I never received monthly ststements from PNC to show payment activity. When I looked over my history in XX/XX/XXXX I noticed some payments were not applied correctly. I called and requested PNC to review my loan starting from inception date in XX/XX/XXXX. PNC acknowledged error and corrected two of the payments in which this lowered my payoff amount. I called back to pnc to let them know there was still two payments to be corrected. I wanted tbe correct payoff amount before paying off my auto. PNC NEVER CALLED BACK. I was always the initiator for the status of inquiry. This started in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX still reviewing case open. In XX/XX/XXXX i called again to convey my frustration. I was told on XX/XX/XXXX there was a decision and they would not consider XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to be posted correctly and recalculate interest as they were too old. But they did reapply another XX/XX/XXXX principal only payment. This was clearly their error and did not post payments correctly therefore I overpaid on my loan. I did payoff loan in november so i did not accrue further daily interest. This loan was paid off approximately one year early with never a late payment. I just want to pay the correct payoff amount with the correct interest applied. If they do this to other people and their defense is that it is up to the consumer to track their payments but they do not hold themselves responsible as to have quality employees to apply payments correctly. They add re making money off this process. My final complaint was if they can not calculate back to those two payments then figure a fair amount that would be refunded to me. They closed complaint and stated they could not help me. This took 4 months to let me know they could not do anything about it. Then their employee that was working on my file lied about calling me back and stating phone number was not good or could not leave voicemail.

157,2020-04-05 00:00:00,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Problem with paying off the loan,"I received Santander FPB Complaint No. : XXXX response from Santander and appreciate Santanders admittance of its predatory lending practices. 

First Santander openly and knowingly is admitting the use of Simple interest method, a predatory practice, which calculates the amount of interest owed first on a daily basis as described in the response. This was not explained to me and I cant honestly say that I understand it now after you have attempted to explain it. This tactic is predatory and unfair. You took advantage of me by offering a product that was confusing and has caused the payments on this loan to extend far beyond the 6 years agreed upon which was XXXX then due to extension to XX/XX/XXXX. It is now XXXX 1 year beyond the agreed upon date and if I continue paying this as agreed it will extend into another year until XXXX 2 years beyond. This tactic is deceptive and has prevented this loan from being satisfied. 

Additionally, knowingly understanding my lack of bargaining power Santander offered terms that would likely prevent on time payments. Santander also has the habit of mailing bills that do not accurately request proper payments. Instead Santanders bills deceitfully state inflating monthly payment amounts causing fear of not being able to pay which in many cases caused a sense of helplessness which detoured payments. For example, on a recent bill dated XXXX the AMOUNT OWED per the bill for XXXX is {$5300.00}, when the actual amount owed for the month is {$430.00}. Knowing that it is impossible to pay {$5300.00} one could potentially refrain from attempting to make a payment due to the inability to pay the amount owed as stated on the bill. Santanders practice of misstating the actual amount is another indication of predatory lending practices. 

Additionally, Santander charged me for GAP insurance as a part of financing of this loan. In XXXX the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection determined Santander violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of XXXX when it added GAP insurance to loans without properly describing its benefits. Santander was sued over 9 million for this practice and this is another citation of its unfair, unethical and abusive lending practices. 

Finally, my contract with Santander was for 6 years with extension request for up to 6 months total. To date this 6 .5year loan is far beyond 8 years and before the loan is paid off if this can happen it will have approached 9 years. Therefore a 6 year loan totaling {$17000.00} will have accrues interest and additional charges for over 29,000 which is 2.5 times the principle balance of the original loan agreement. This is abusive and unacceptable. As you already know Santander is facing a class action lawsuit for charging improper fees and for improper telephone tactics which again clearly highlights my victimization by Santander. 

I am requesting a refund in the amount of {$10000.00} which include excessive fees and interest incurred and Santanders repeated 32attempt to take advantage of this subprime borrower.",None,Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.,VA,222XX,None,Consent provided,Web,2020-04-05 00:00:00,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3636223

161,2020-02-04 00:00:00,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Struggling to pay your loan,Denied request to lower payments,"IDA should be ashamed of their predatory collections and business practices during this state of emergency involving COVID-19 global pandemic. Though I've made ALL payments on time, IDA would not work with me on payment arrangements since my paycheck was significantly short this month. They should not be allowed to prey on the working poor, and they must provide hardship programs during this pandemic. Today, it was made obvious to me THEY CARE NOTHING ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS WHO KEEP THEM IN BUSINESS BY PAYING OUTRAGEOUSLY HIGH INTEREST RATES. 

I contacted them via email on XX/XX/XXXX stating : "" Hello. As this COVID-19 crisis has hit us, I've not been at work for several weeks now and will tentatively return to work on XX/XX/XXXX. I just got paid and was disgustingly shocked at how much was taken out of my check in addition to not being paid for the "" extra '' like after school tutoring ( I turned in my timesheet so not sure why that wasn't on my paycheck ). The amount is significantly lower to really limit me in paying all of my bills, including my car payment. I've attached XXXX 's, XXXX 's, XXXX 's, and XXXX 's paychecks for documentation of the drastic difference in pay. Being my bank account was already overdrawn and had already gone over my overdraft privilege of - {$500.00}, this significant decrease in pay has seriously hurt my family in such desperate times. 

I'm letting you all know in writing so we can work together to come up with a solution .... possible deference until I receive our stimulus check of roughly {$3400.00} ... .partial payment until I get paid again and can caught up on the past due balance. After rent, water, lights, and car insurance, I have {$300.00} left and haven't bought enough groceries and supplies to get us through this quarantine. It's my greatest hope we can work together on a solution to get my account paid up as soon as possible. Thank you! '' I received a threatening text from one of IDA 's reps today stating, "" Payment is past due. Vehicle will be repossessed and/or disabled if payment isn't made. Broken payment arrangement on XX/XX/20. Please contact IDA immediately. '' Well, I'd already emailed them to document in writing and providing documentation ( my last four paycheck stubs indicating this month 's drastic difference in my pay ). I also called today to explain what's going on but had to leave a message. A rude rep returned my call and cut me off before I could even explain what was going on and how it's affecting my family. She said she received my email and that they don't do hardship programs. I offered to make one weekly payment of {$140.00}, and she refused my offer. My loan was sold to IDA in XXXX, GA by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, GA without my knowledge until after the fact. IDA is charging outrageous interest rates. {$140.00} weekly for a XXXX XXXX XXXX with XXXX miles on it is ludicrous. However, with my husband going through XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX within 3 months time back in XXXX, our credit has suffered as a result of him being on XXXX now, and we were forced to purchase a vehicle from a shady used car dealership. They prey on the working poor, and it's shameful. 

Since my loan was purchased by IDA, I've only received two receipts so I never know how much I'm paying down on my debt. You can only pay online if your account is current. They keep telling me I'm past due {$600.00}, but I began making payments with them as soon as I received paperwork from them in the mail. Their business practices are unethical and highly questionable. Their customer service reps also need to be trained in how to deal with their customers in a nice, sympathetic, and professional manner. 

During this COVID-19 pandemic, auto loan companies like IDA should not be sending threatening texts when families are already under a high level of stress. They should not be allowed to use predatory collection measures during a state of emergency. These people have no moral compass whatsoever. I email Mr. XXXX, the owner, personally forwarding the email I'd sent to their general email address. I have not received a response just as I did not receive a response from the customer service rep though she admitted to reading it. She had the time to send a nasty text, however. This company needs to be stopped immediately before other families such as mine are hurt too.

To the owner of IDA, I also added in my email : "" A customer service rep of yours was very unsympathetic to my family 's situation this morning and was borderline rude to me and then to my husband when he called back after I was in tears after getting off the phone with her. See emails and documentation of my significant decrease in pay this month attached below. I have XXXX sons at home during this quarantine. Thanks to IDA, I have been forced into making my full car payment instead of seeing my children get what they need during this pandemic. I thought surely someone at IDA would have a heart and offer some kind of help, but I was sorely wrong. I urge you, sir, to provide customers some type of financial relief during this COVID-19 pandemic. I understand your business is open to make profits, but considering the high interest rates charged I feel a temporary deferment plan could be implemented. I have a college student, a high school student, and a XXXX year old with XXXX that are depending on me and to have transportation in order to get supplies while we're in quarantine. I have {$200.00} in my bank account. My husband 's XXXX of a whopping {$720.00} comes in Friday. XXXX  is giving us until Friday to pay {$600.00}. Please advise how we can give most of our money to IDA and feed our family. We can't get govt. assistance, churches are handing out very little food, and we do not have any family support system. When we make this payment on Friday, just know my children will be doing without due to IDA 's unethical, predatory business practices. If any solution can be made, I'm more than willing to work with you all. I've made my payments faithfully since my loan was sold to IDA. I've received two receipts the entire time I've been a customer and both were from XXXX XXXX who was always very nice. The other reps really need training in customer service.

177,11/25/2019,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Struggling to pay your loan,Lender trying to repossess or disable the vehicle,"We have had a loan on our vehicle, opened to finance the purchase of the vehicle, issued and held by XXXX Bank since XXXX, account number XXXX. In the last 3 years, our vehicle has been repossessed 3 times for payments that were less than 90 days past due, which is contrary to the terms of our loan agreement. We have established in prior communications with XXXX bank that our contract states that repossessions will only occur after an account is 90 days past due, but that they process repossessions after accounts fall 60 days past due regardless of these terms. 

We have made numerous attempts to resolve this issue with the company via phone, from discussing the circumstances under which the vehicle has been repossessed, requesting a full payment history of the account, asking for payment arrangements after repossession regardless of the impropriety of the bank 's action and requesting support setting up automated payments to avoid late payments in future. We have been advised by the company that their practices do not align with the terms of our contract ( above ), that automated payments can only be set up by using paper forms submitted through the mail, and that they will not make any arrangements for payment after repossession regardless of circumstance excepting holding the vehicle for up to 10 days prior to sale. Each time this situation has occurred, we have paid the requested amount in full in order to have the vehicle released, as we need the vehicle to transport ourselves to work and our children to school. 

The first repossession was removed from our credit reporting. While XXXX has subsequently refused to acknowledge any action taken on our reporting, we assume this was removed due to the bank 's practice of repossessing vehicles prior accounts falling 90 days past due, as described above. The last repossession still appears on our credit reporting despite this same practice leading to repossession. XXXX bank is also not providing us with paper or electronic statements for this account, which makes it impossible for us to review and understand our balance or the amount they claim is due. 

As you can see from the attached images, we have not been provided any notice of these amounts prior to repossession. When we login to our online payment portal, the only thing that shows is that our last payment was due 71 days ago as of today, which, per the Federal Consumer Credit Reporting Act, does not, in fact, constitute 90 days past due. The account information screen does not provide a total amount due, only the amount of the individual payment for each month, as well as the last due date for which payment is due. We also have elected for electronic statement delivery on this account ( see attached photo ), which we've had set up on this account since it was first opened. When we attempted after the call this morning to verify the amount due, we discovered that we have never been issued, nor can we retrieve, any statements for or notices about this account whatsoever. 

At this time, the bank is requiring payment well in excess of the amount that should actually due on the account before releasing the vehicle, based on the information available to us as account holders through our online portal. We have received nothing in the mail from XXXX bank regarding the status of this account, nor have any statements or notices been issued to us online. 

On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, around XXXX XXXX  Central time, our vehicle, a blue XXXX XXXX, was repossessed from our home at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TN XXXX. Payment on that date was 69 days past due. 

We were advised by the tow company that they received the repossession order by fax or electronic transmission on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, around XXXX XXXX   Central time. Because XXXX closes their call lines at XXXX XXXX. Eastern time on Saturdays, we were unable to contact them to discuss resolution until Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. Central, I was able to contact a representative, XXXX, in their call center using the number XXXX. 

In this recorded call, XXXX confirmed that payment on the vehicle was approximately 70 days past due at the time of repossession, and also confirmed that XXXX "" considers '' that to be 90 days past due. She advised me that the total amount due to recover the vehicle from the tow company was {$1800.00}. She confirmed that this figure is composed of the following amounts : {$1300.00} past due balance ; {$70.00} fees ; {$440.00} repossession fee. 

Based on the information provided online, our account payment is set at {$350.00} per month. Payments in this amount for XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX add up to {$1000.00}.

On XX/XX/XXXX, As I did not receive a call back from Citibank I contacted them again at XXXX. During this call again a rep verified me and passed me on again to the security team, the same story again that they would need to verify my account with CIT bank and they cant do it while on the phone and that they would need to initiate the call. I told them I was unhappy about the fact that my money was debited and they cant tell me how or when they can resolve the problem. They promised to call me back quickly and asked me to keep my phone close to me. I did not receive a call back. I was genuinely worried about the missing {$15000.00} and kept checking my accounts daily to hoping that there was a resolution. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I saw a pending return transaction for {$15000.00} on CIT bank and then I again contacted Citibank at XXXX to ensure my account was put back in good standing. This time the rep I spoke with was more understanding, but said until the return transaction is confirmed they cant remove the block on my account, but once this return is confirmed that should automatically verify the account. And he expected it to happen the next day. I received an email from Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX   informing me that my inter institution transfer was restored. I immediately initiated a same day transfer out for the {$650.00} in the account to XXXX XXXX XXXX account with the intent of closing the Citi account once the transfer was complete. This was posted to the XXXX account on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Citibank account still continues to show this transaction as in progress when I checked on XXXX. I called Citibank on XXXX to close my account and they put me on hold for 25 minutes while they researched and came back and informed me that my account was on hold and they need to verify my CIT account again. They will be unable to close my account without verifying the CIT bank account. I informed the rep that I did not have a pending transaction with CIT bank and since I am not interested in continuing my relationship with Citibank they don't have to worry about verifying the CIT Bank account for funds transfer. The rep informed the only way i can close the account is by calling next day and verfying the CIT Bank account. 

I am worried that Citibank is going to use this as pretext to reverse the {$650.00} in progress transaction with XXXX XXXX and keep this account perpetually open or keep charging me monthly fees. They also left the {$15000.00} in settlement account instead of crediting my account, putting it on hold while they verified the account and paying me the promised interest. I would like CFPB to help escalate this complaint and close this account. Also I would like Citibank to compensate me for lost interest and time over the past two weeks trying to resolve this entire situation over the past 2 weeks.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",TX,782XX,None,Consent provided,Web,2019-06-08 00:00:00,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3330974

I initially sent RAC a Lienholder/Lessor report of total loss on XX/XX/19, that they were to complete and return to XXXX XXXX so they could process and pay out on the claim. They failed to return the form. I placed multiple phone calls to RAC to see what the hold up was from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. Nobody was able to give me an answer.

226,8/28/2019,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a travel trailer from XXXX XXXX XXXX  in XXXX, Ohio. The loan for the vehicle was arranged through XXXX XXXX Bank and the installment loan terms were set at 11.25 % for 144 months with the first payment due on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have cancelled checks, bank statements and receipts that demonstrate that 144 consecutive payments of {$220.00} were made between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. All but one was made within the 10-day due date grace period. Due to prior commitments I was unable to make it to the bank before they closed and I was assessed a {$40.00} late fee the payment was made one day late on XX/XX/XXXX and the late fee was paid. The total amount paid over the 12 years was {$32000.00} ( i.e., 144 payments of {$220.00} for a total of {$32000.00} plus the {$40.00} late fee ). 

Not all payments were made on the due date so I anticipated a final balance of around {$50.00} to account for cumulative miscellaneous interest. However, in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, Huntington National Bank which took over the loan from XXXX after their merger a claim was made that I sill had an outstanding principal balance of {$480.00} and that I owed a further {$3.00} in interest on that balance. 

Repeat calls to Huntington have failed to resolve the discrepancy in payment history. Agents and supervisors for the bank have claimed that several payments were deferred or missed. On a few occasions, when the representative provided a date for an allegedly missed payment - and I indicated that I had a cancelled check and receipt that proves a payment was made - they simply stated that is not what the system shows. 

Nobody has been willing or able to provide documentation that a request to defer a payment was made or that shows a payment was missed. A statement provided by XXXX for tax purposes on XX/XX/XXXX indicates that the account was current and all payments made and applied. Please note : 1 ) I never received any notices by mail that suggested the loan was not current ; and 2 ) virtually all payments were made in-person at the local branch and I was never advised of an issue with the loan or the repayment schedule. 

It may also be important to note that the XXXX statement ledger from XXXX does not reflect a standard amortization schedule or simple interest formula - an issue that has persisted since the loan was arranged. The loan calculations fees, payment amount, and totals never matched the signed Promissory Note. As an example : their statement indicates that the first payment was dedicated fully to interest with none applied to the principal. When asked about this, I was advised that the system will catch-up something that apparently never happened. The issues with this loan may have been an isolated mistake but if habitual and applied to additional accounts it could be large scale fraud ( i.e., {$1.00} per installment for a single account is a rounding-error for a large company but if applied to millions of accounts with frequency it would be significant ). 

I have been advised that two cases were opened to reverse the deferral or investigate the misapplied payment but there has been no change in status. In fact, the last representative threatened me with additional late fees, interest and collection activity if I did not pay the balance they indicate in-full within the next 2 days. The agent refused to suspend the due date until the issue has been investigated and a proper balance calculated. 

At this point, it is clear that the customer service agents and supervisors representing Huntington National Bank have no interest in investigating let alone resolving - this issue. Attempts to escalate the problem within the company have failed. Unfortunately, it appears as though formal complaints and the threat of legal action may be required to gain proper attention to this problem.

230,2019-04-09 00:00:00,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"In XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a motorcycle. I had my loan financed through a bank called MB Financial. Around sometime in XX/XX/XXXX, they merged with 5/3 bank. I was never informed of this. Today ( XX/XX/2019 ), I checked my credit score and noticed my motorcycle loan with 5/3 was delinquent. 

This was very surprising to me for several reasons. 1 ) I had set up auto-pay using their online tool. 2 ) I had never received a phone call alerting me of the first notice of delinquency. 3 ) I also never received a letter notifying me of delinquency.

I called 5/3 bank and immediately brought my account current. I was told the following information over the phone : - MB Financial and 5/3 bank merged in XXXX - Apparently what I set up was not auto-pay, but some other confusing form of payment, even though I scheduled future payments - The phone number they had listed on my account is a phone number that has never had any association with me. I have no idea whose phone number it was, this would explain why I never received a phone call - I then asked why since they verified they had my personal cell phone on file, they made no attempt to call that number. I was told they need verification from the individual first in order to call regarding delinquency. If this is the case, how and why were they able to call the other phone number with no association to me? 
- I asked why I never received a letter to notify me of delinquency. I was told "" I don't know '' - I was then informed my motorcycle is being searched for by a repossession team. 
- I was told to file a complain with the FTC regarding the 80 point hit to my credit score and negative remark on my credit report - I was told because of my calm demeanor, that they would most likely be willing to work with me - I then called back to confirm I could get someone to alert the crediting bureau of the mistake - I was on the phone for 47 minutes being transferred 3 times to different departments - I was told under no circumstances, would an adjustment be made to my credit report on good faith, and that the only way they would be willing to help me out would be to provide them with proof of payments I made to the account during the months it was delinquent. This is obviously impossible, and I never made payments those months because 1 ) I assumed auto pay was working as intended 2 ) I was never notified via phone call or letter that my account was delinquent. 

Overall I can't even describe how upset I am at the way this bank has treated me as a customer. I would like to have my situation resolved and the adjustment made to my credit report due to the way the collections department handled the situation.

I have written a letter to your place of business requesting copies of every single document that they have in their files in regards to my account and I received nothing as a response to but an e-mail requesting that I could sign in online to view my account history but when I do so the history in after dating question and not for the entire duration of the contract. And to add to that what they did instead was inputted into their computer system that I now have a balance of {$1300.00} because I was asking them to return to me any excess monies paid to them after satisfying my account balance. because by law it is rightfully mine and should have been returned to me as soon as the payments were made. not only did they not supply me with any of my paperwork to document any of the details and how the appropriated any of the refund money but I also never received the title for the vehicle in which the entire loan payment was made for. As well as they have now somehow added a {$1400.00} charge to my account but have no documentation explaining why or how that number was reached or why they feel entitled to such an amount. It is also incurring interest as if I was still under contract with them which is false because the terms of the contract were met and the account was closed and that was explained to me in one of the phone calls that I made to them. they should not be allowed to charge me for attempted charge me any money without them furnishing up and supplying the paperwork necessary to substantiate such claims. They also negatively impacted by credit score for months after the accident stating that I was past due on payments when in fact they had already received payment the loan. So all around this company is doing awful business they are not meeting terms that they should be and are not supplying any paperwork as to their conduct on that side of the contract. I have upheld my side of the contract and I believe that they should be held to theirs as well.

248,2019-09-10 00:00:00,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Struggling to pay your loan,Loan balance remaining after the vehicle is repossessed and sold,"My vehicle ( a XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX ), was repossessed 2 days before XXXX XXXX. This occurred after I repetitively sent letters to capital one indicating financial hardship due to automobile accident involving the seat belt and brake component of the vehicle and that the above vehicle was involved in a National recall for model years XXXX to XXXX. 
I also notified Capital one that I have obtained a lawyer to assist me due to the fact the manufacturer at that time was not able to fix the issue until sometime the next year and this along with a faulty engine qualifies the vehicle as a lemon. 
After realizing that the vehicle was repossessed, I immediately logged into the online portal. Upon indebt review of the account, I saw that of the original loan amount of {$27000.00}, I had a paid to date total of {$33000.00}, and of the {$33000.00} that was paid {$20000.00} was applied to interest and only {$12000.00} applied to the principal. 
At no time upon accepting the auto loan with Capital one was I informed or notified that majority of payments would be applied to interest as opposed to the principal. Additionally there was an exorbitant amount of fees and charges being applied to the account in addition to reporting of late payments and repossession when there was none thus negatively impacting my credit score and history. Also at the initiation of the loan I was informed of an added bonus of Gap coverage for the vehicle since it was a brand new vehicle, to which I learned was never included at the time of engine failure in XXXX which required a brand new engine. 
Capital one sent a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX which stated the vehicle will be sold after XX/XX/XXXX. About 2 weeks after I received a call from Capital one stating the vehicle was sold. When I requested the amount that the vehicle was sold for the representative declined to disclose that information. Fast forward to this year and review of my credit report I see that capital one had continued to report to all credit reporting agencies that I had an active auto loan the was months past due and horrifically reflected a balance as if the vehicle was still in my possession. There was also a failure on Capital One 's behalf to report the $ XXXX that was already paid to them in addition to the {$2700.00} that was paid to them on XX/XX/XXXX, which would have a ) brought my account current and b ) prevented the repossession from ever occurring. Lastly, in XXXX of XXXX I applied for economic hardship which would allow for lower payments to be made for a certain number of months not to exceed 12 months. However when approval was obtained the monthly payments was lowered slightly from {$630.00} a month to {$550.00} a month with a additional charge for notifying the lender of hardship and approval for lowered payments thus extending the loan term from 72 months at XXXX/monthly to 96 months at $ XXXX/monthly!!! 
In summary, Capital One Auto finance uses deceptive marketing and financial practices when dealing with individuals with less than optimum credit and most disheartening they use predatory lending practices in the form of interest rates such as mine which was 26.98 %. 
Applying that high interest rate to monthly payments and late payments thus padding overall charges leading to inability to remain current with payments. The subsequent repossession of this vehicle also served as a removal of evidence for the lawsuit that was initiated for defects that XXXX XXXX XXXX admitted to not having a resolution for and in a email to me indicating that the company would reimburse me for renting a vehicle on a monthly basis due to the open recall whilst still liable for loan payments to Capital one.

256,2019-07-10 00:00:00,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Unable to receive car title or other problem after the loan is paid off,"The company in which I have a vehicle loan went out of business due to fraudulent activities to thousands of people like myself. I am attaching websites to show the length of unethical activities they participated in as it relates to my own situation. Apparently, when they went out of business, they sold the existing vehicle loans to a unknowingly third party company in which they did not transfer accurate records. I have been locked out of the online portal of my online account several times after calling the number given to me from the former Gateway One company to reach the third party company that is supposed to be handling the completion of the vehicle loans after the company went out of business. I have called hundreds of times to fight to gain access to my statement after the third party company told me verbally over the phone that my balance was always over {$900.00} even after I called in to pay my bill, the balance never went down. I was transferred from another country ( where the 1-800 #  routes you to ) and I requested to speak with someone in America. Everytime I was transferred to someone in America, they told me that they did not see that I owed {$900.00} plus dollars. The third party company outside of America stated that I had two repossessions of this vehicle and that is what made up the extra money owed. My vehicle has never been repossessed. I have never received any court documents, certified mail or notification of a repossion since I have owned this vehicle. The vehicle has never been taken from me in any way. I again called hundreds of times to find out how this happened. I was hung up on from the international person that transferred me over for several months. I contacted my local attorney general 's office to get help. They researched this and told me that their were thousands of complaints and the company was forced out of business by the courts. They helped me get Gateway one to give me access to the statement so that I could see the false charges on my statement. They also helped me put a fraud alert on all of my credit reports. They stated that since the company was out of business, the credit reports would investigate it and remove it. After I gained access to my online statement, I saw the false repossession charges myself. I called back again to Gateway One and asked to speak with someone in America. I spoke to a woman who introduced herself as the manager of the  repossession department. She stated that her name was XXXX. She put me on hold and pulled up my account number. She came back on the line and stated, no you do not have any repossessions under your account. I will contact the accounting department to have this removed. I asked for a copy of all of my records from Gateway One to  ensure that nothing was showing up under my name. The attorney general also asked me to do this so that I can see any certified mail, court documents or FDIC required documents that Gateway One would have had to file in order to initiate or administer a repossession under my name. I was told that since their was no repossession, there was nothing that she could send me. So, the attorney general helped me mail a packet of evidence to each credit bureau to get the false and inflated repossession charges off my statement so that I can have the correct pay-off amount. I paid it down to under {$2000.00} at this point, but with the fees, it is still showing over {$4000.00} in error. When the credit bureaus investigated this, Gateway One ( who refused to respond to me or the attorney general with evidence of any repossession paperwork or notification date and sign stamped or certified ) send false statements to the credit bureau and are continuing to report the wrong amount on my credit report. This has been going on for over two and a half years. After Gateway One went out of business, the new administrator has told me several times that they have no evidence or paperwork of any repossession under my name. However, after the credit reporting agencies investigated them, they must have supplied false documents to get the credit agencies to keep the wrong amount on file which shows not only one, but TWO repossessions. I called back to Gateway One after getting an update from the credit bureaus. I spoke to XXXX who stated that he was the manager. He again assured me that no repossessions were showing up under this account and that he was going to speak to his manager to review the statement and have an updated copy showing no false repossession fees. He stated that he would mail me a copy of the updated statement showing me the accurate pay-off amount so that I could pay it off and have the correct amount. He never contacted me back. A few months went by and Gateway One again sent a 3rd party person in another company to call me stating that I owed over {$900.00} including two repossession fees. The company went out of business due to falsifying thousands of people like my account. It has been very frustrating to try to show integrity and pay off this loan when they refuse to remove false repossession fees and destroying my credit. I would like to see a copy of the certified court stamped repossession documents signed by a judge, a copy of all of my internal records from Gateway One and all of their third party contractors and a copy of the information they submitted to all three credit bureaus.

I went back up there to talk with the manager of the dealership and he walked around the entire dealership inside and out looking for my explorer knowing full well he had it towed away. I recorded the entire visit. I talked to XXXX XXXX XXXX  and relayed this information to them. They suggested that I file a police report.

XXXX XXXX, 'Specialist ' in Kentucky-XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : Huntington Bank Auto Loan Loan no. : XXXX Complaint : Lost Title Customer Service : I signed a loan agreement at the XXXX, Michigan XXXX branch on XXXX. I financed a XXXX XXXX. The branch vice-president, XXXX XXXX, kept the title to the vehicle. Michigan Secretary of State ( DMV ) claims I was supposed to be given the vehicle title. 
I went to buy a plate and was refused and told to not drive it until the vehicle was registered to me, which couldnt be done since the title was lost. I called XXXX and she replied that the title had to go to Ohio where they would process it, per Bank procedure. She assured me the paperwo4rk would be filed.

I went back to the SOS  office on XXXX. After 2 hours in line, I was again refused a license plate. They need the title. I called XXXX ; she replied that the title was mail along with the sales tax money to Michigan. I replied that this would be two entirely different State departments. She replied tht its all Michigan and it doesnt matter. I was told to just wait for the system to update, and I the meantime to just drive the XXXX on the wrong plate ( a Michigan law violation ). 
I went back to SOS on XXXX, 2.5 hours in line, 3 counter-persons exclaiming what a mess Huntington had created. I emailed XXXX XXXX, Home Loan Specialist in Kentucky. XXXX had processed the application and loan approval. Ive saved XXXX emails with his own disingenuousness but Ill stay on the Title topic. 
I called XXXX again ; she stated that the title would be XXXX to me overnight mil, but that it wouldnt show up until Tuesday XXXX. I asked if she knew why her overnight was half a week. She hung up on me. It didnt show up on Tuesday. 
I went to SOS Tuesday, XXXX. This time it was only an hour in line, plus the drive time. Again, nothing on file from Huntington. I called XXXX ; she scolded me saying the paperwork wasnt due, to me, until later in the day. I emailed XXXX. He replied that the Michigan SOS had received the title but it could take weeks to process the title into the system. 
Now all of this is in addition to the original loan proble, which was an increase in the points from XXXX to XXXX. I was told, after the loan was signed, by XXXX and also XXXX, that the increase was due to rolling the paperwork fees into the loan. I asked why I wasnt told to pay the XXXX since I had already paid a {$2000.00} down payment precisely to keep the payments down. XXXX wouldnt answer and XXXX says he didnt say this. I saved his email. 
I want a reduction in the loan APR. I want the loan rewritten. I was the title found and delivered to the SOS office on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, MI.

269,8/22/2019,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Problem with additional products or services purchased with the loan,"I purchased a car from DriveTime on XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I financed through XXXX, the in-house bank. The entire process took all day and when it came time to sign my documents there were three aftermarket products, from XXXX, added to my loan that ended up costing an extra {$5200.00}. I asked the salesman what they were and he was a little surprised that NO ONE had gone over or tried to sell them to me, instead, I bought ALL of them without my consent or even any knowledge of what they were. So when I told the guy I dont want or need them the manager came over and said we would have to start the whole process over to take them off. I suppose thats part of the scam. I was exhausted at this point and he says or you can just call and easily have them canceled. I have called and submitted the cancellation forms multiple times and they are still on my car loan and I am being charged interest. Not just an easy phone call as promised! I want the products removed from my loan immediately and I want every penny of interest that I have paid on the aftermarket amount, beginning from day one, credited back to my account. XXXX, of course, is refusing to take them off. On top of that, I was behind on my car payment but got caught up on all payments on XX/XX/XXXX by making a payment of {$2300.00} to them. The gal said that would make me current. On XX/XX/XXXX I logged in to check my account and like she said it was paid up and current. It also stated my next payment date was XX/XX/XXXX and I owed {$130.00} ( I have a screenshot of this as proof ). I log on to pay it on XX/XX/XXXX to make sure I don't fall behind and it says my account is past due in the amount of {$200.00}!!! I call and they tell me too bad it must have updated and refuses to take the late fee off. So apparently the Drivetime store managers lie to your face and they back them up, the customer service reps lie and tell you you are caught up, and the computer account screen is a liar as well. I want nothing to do with this company or any of its affiliates and would pay off the loan but I REFUSE to pay for the {$5200.00} in illegal add ons by scams, lies, and disgraceful behavior to a first-time car buyer but of course they refuse to do the right thing. I understand the contract but as I said I was scammed by the manager. He encouraged me to sign the contract with the products on it like it was the only choice I had. I have never been this blatantly taken advantage of in my life and I want this brought to every consumer 's attention in the US to warn them to under NO circumstance should they believe any manager,  customer service rep or even the account you log into for information at XXXX. I am sick and tired of XXXX  unwilling attitude to do the right thing and just remove the products and any interest that I have paid on that amount. Maybe this is all part of the way they make money, all part of a bigger scam starting the process at DriveTime and continuing it with XXXX? If it wasn't part of a scam I would think that they would immediately do the only honest thing to resolve this. I guess they are not a company with any values or willingness to help customers who get taken advantage of by them. I have NEVER used or wanted the products, and yet they still want to collect my money for them. I have already contacted an investigative department to do a story about this and they are interested. I guarantee once it airs on TV they will have MANY, MANY more complaints about the same type of scam then just mine. I would also like to see what legal actions can be taken? I understand the contract and all but that is why law enforcement has fraud departments to help people who were taken advantage of by businesses that refuse to make their bad decision right. I will call the top CEO, the IRS, the FBI, the police department and TV studios if I need too. Please let me know what to do next because I will never stop until they take these products off my loan that they illegally put on. Maybe they need a class on how to be a better business!

294,12/28/2019,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"My complaint is simple : fraud occurred on my Charles Schwab accounts attached to my brokerage accounts, it was reported in a timely manner, and I have not been refunded almost one year later. Multiple Charles Schwab representatives have left me hanging for almost 12 months, some making false promises only to pass the buck to a different customer service agent. Schwab promises its clients, Schwab will cover 100 % of any losses in any of your Schwab accounts due to unauthorized activity. It offers two caveats : 1 ) a customer must safeguard his or her accounts by not sharing account access information and 2 ) reporting the fraud as quickly as possible. As such, my hospital stay was one in which an order for XXXX XXXX was entered to save my life. I did not give any information whatsoever to any person on earth, and I reported the fraud as soon as I was out of the hospital and had access to my belongings once again ( they had been in a XXXX locker for weeks ). I have never shared the actual debit card nor have I given out my PIN number to a single soul. Per Schwabs request, I gave them the suspect name XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. 

A brief narrative : After a XXXX XXXX stay for stage XXXX XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX, I returned home to fraudulent actions on both my checking and savings accounts at Charles Schwab. The nature of the criminal activity is debit card abuse at an ATM. There were 3 errors on my checking and 56 on my savings. The fraudulent activity included a series of XX/XX/XXXX ATM cash withdrawals ( done in increments of {$200.00} and {$400.00} ) topping {$18000.00} done over the time period of my XXXX XXXX. The address for the criminal activity is XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Texas. All fraudulent transactions took place while I was XXXX   at XXXX. I immediately reported the fraud to Charles Schwab, and the claim is still pending with them. The debit card number used in these fraudulent transactions is XXXX. 

I submitted all requested documentation to Charles Schwab, including a police report and confirmation of my XXXX XXXX. The police also confirmed my XXXX XXXX and stated for the record that I was defrauded. I was initially refunded by XXXX XXXX before it was soon reversed with no notification or warning. Several months later XXXX XXXX promised to refund me on three occasions before blaming not being able to do so on a committee. The latest representative from the Client Advocacy Team, XXXX XXXX, has told me he will look into how the fraud was not detected when it was completely different to my patterns over the years ( I do not use ATMs ). Telephone banker XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, told me my personal banker was  XXXX XXXX. This lined up with the series of sales emails I received from him, and so I directly called and emailed him with no response. After the contact and a mention of filing a complaint, he was surreptitiously removed from my accounts. Charles Schwab accepted no responsibility for this error and blamed it on me. As a customer, this meant no one over the phone or at the branch was willing to stand by the Schwab guarantee. This is terrible and unacceptable and a complete violation of my financial rights. 

These events are terrifying to any customer, but to go through this on your XXXX when you need the funds for a XXXX XXXX and your family ( my wife is XXXX with our XXXX XXXX ),  it is especially troubling and traumatic. Rather than making positional personal assumptions, Schwab should stand by a defrauded customer and not ignore its security guarantee to bully a XXXX customer. 

Charles Schwab has not stood by its security guarantee in protecting my accounts. I ask that this be escalated within the bank to a leader who can rectify the situation and finally restore me for the fraud I have endured. 

I am also submitting this claim on behalf of my wife, XXXX, who is a signer on the accounts.

All negotiation was done by Salesman which I have emails that proved that I gave him my personal information. It was the first time that I was buying a new car so he told me that it would be better if I give my personal information to him so he could deal with the financial institution. XXXX- After almost of 2 years paying my auto loan on time ( paid {$17000.00} ) and without any late payment I contacted the financial institution First Help Financial to inform them that due to Covid- 19 Pandemic I had a substantial loss of income and I could not pay my loan on time the way that I was doing for all the time that I had my car loan. XXXXEven with all challenges due to this pandemic and my economic hardship situation I paid my car loan and they charged me a late fee. After this payment I asked the institution to send my contract copy loan so I could compare with the contract that I had in my hands and see if I could refinance my car loan with another financial institution with a better interest rate since my credit score improved drastically. XXXX First Help Financial sent the contract to me and for my surprise the contract that they sent has a signature that was not mine. IT WAS FORGED. Another thing is that the contract that they sent to me was different from the one that I signed with the XXXX XXXX XXXX. The amount financed is different from the contract that I have in my hands. Also the down payment value is different and the gap insurance does not appear in the forged contract.

I also contacted the GAP insurance company XXXX XXXX, which is the company that the salesman told me that I have my GAP insurance/ contract signed by me and the company said that according to my VIN number they never had any contract with them.

After realizing that I was the victim of a scam I am constantly trying to contact the companies involved in this contract.

The statement reads bill due XX/XX/19.

Clearly not a valid excuse on Santander. I demanded my payment be accredited to my account as there is only 1 bill due and I paid it already. I ask them to fix my account and get it right the first time. After another hold, she returned by stating they need another 3-5 days to fix the mistake. She stated the first agent put in a request for a due date issue and not the issue of the erroneous mistake made by their own billing department with regards to my new loan account. Once again, I am at their mercy to do what is right and fix my account to accredit the payment made in XX/XX/XXXX to reflect the payment due for XX/XX/19.This is not ethical nor a legal transaction that has occurred but rather an unscrupulous attempt to con me into paying off principal at their discretion and ignoring the first payment for the new auto loan.

I have never initiated a wire transfer in my life, nor did I initiate this wire transfer, nor have I ever been asked to provided written authorization for wire transfers. I promptly called my bank, USAA, and informed them of the fraudulent activity. A report was made, and an investigation began, and I was reassured I would get the funds returned to the account. Within an hour of initiating the report, I received a call from the fraud investigator assigned to my case. She proceeded to tell me that because the fraudster was able to get into my account easily using my username and password that USAA was not liable for recouping the funds lost. She stated a recall on the wire was sent and an investigation would follow. I never heard back from the fraud team, was never asked any questions or asked to give any information to help with the investigation. The evening of XX/XX/XXXX I called USAA to receive further clarification on how it is possible that I would be held liable for fraudulent activity that the bank allowed regardless of various elements of the activity that should have raised red flags. Red flags that should have been raised regarding the wire transfer include the following : I have never signed anything stating that I authorize wire transfers from any of my accounts, I have never conducted a wire transfer before in my life let alone with USAA, the request was presumably from a unauthorized IP address on an unauthorized device, for the amount of {$9500.00} ( only XXXX less than the amount legally required to be reported federally ). I am left to assume the wire was initiated from and sent to a distant location as no one at USAA could give me any information on the IP address where the wire was initiated or sent. Not keeping record of this data alone is suspicious for negligence in addition to the fact that USAA 's "" verification '' process for a wire transfer of half the funds in an account is not commercially reasonable. The "" verification '' process for the wire transfer included inserting user name and password. There was apparently a code sent to an email address on file. However, I have only received verification codes sent in the form of text messages to my mobile phone and have never verified my identity via email. I also have no record of such an email. In addition, because this is not routinely the verification method used or agreed upon by the Bank and the Service,  USAA should be liable for any losses through the fraudulent transfer. 

After the call with USAA on the evening of the XXXX I called the XX/XX/XXXX police department to file a police report. I was informed by the police that without the location of where the wire was initiated or sent to I would be unable to properly file a report in correct jurisdiction. 

On the morning of the XXXX of XX/XX/XXXXI called USAA to reach the wire department to try to obtain information regarding the location of the transfer to file the report. No one was able to give me that information further delaying the police report. I was sent to wire resolutions who informed me I should be protected as the wire was clearly fraudulent and I was a victim of an account take over. I was then transferred to the Account Takeover Team who told me I was not a victim of account takeover but actually considered a third party to a scam due to the fact my information was compromised. After denying my right to be protected against fraudulent transactions reported well within the 60 days of the event I requested to escalate the situation to the manager. After reviewing my file the manager of the Account Takeover Team informed me that there was a letter addressed to me in my file stating that my request for return of funds had been denied and the case had been closed. This was the first I had heard of this resolution as I had not been contacted by the Fraud Investigators since XX/XX/XXXX when they informed me that all they could do was initiate a wire recall. The manager proceeded to file a complaint to the CEO on my behalf and told me there was no one else who I would be able to speak to regarding the matter. 

The afternoon of XX/XX/XXXX I filed a police report with XX/XX/XXXX police. I also filed a report with the FBI, Ic3.gov which is a division of the FBI, the FTC Federal Trade Commission , and the CFPB Consumer Financial Protection Bureau .

The company had marked my XXXX payment as 30 days late when not even a day has passed. I called on the XXXX and was not even able to get an answer to how this happen. They just wanted me to pay what was due which was XXXX and some change. The first gentleman didn't even try to listen to me stating my payment was XXXX, and once I paid this off the account would be closed. I finally got to send a dispute on behalf after questioning it several times. I had questions on how this can happen, and he absolutely refused to help me what so ever. Just trying to get me to pay despite my understanding it should have been taken out of my account already. I finally went to pay over phone and there was a fee attach to pay over the phone. So not only did they drop my credit score for a payment that was never late, but they wanted me to spend extra to pay what was left. I called to get a person again, and once more had trouble getting any help. The woman stated my auto pay was canceled and said I must have canceled it. Which is not true. When it was set up I was told it would go until I didn't owe anymore. Again it was hard to get any answers out of her. When I asked about me getting marked late she said I've been late on my payment which is not true. I had one late in XX/XX/2016 which I quickly cleared up.

Honestly I'm extremely frustrated because I've been working so hard to get my credit up, and at the whim of this company they decided to mark me late for no reason.

She requested that I give her the three-digit security code on the back of my Bank of America debit card in order to confirm my identity. I thought that this was a scam call so I hung up. 

I immediately logged into my Bank of America Mobile Banking Application on my phone to check my accounts. When I tried to log in, I received an alert that my password had been changed and that my account had been locked. I reset my password and continued on with my day. 

The next day, XX/XX/2019, while checking my banking mobile app, I saw that a transaction Discover Card ending in XXXX for the amount of {$5700.00} was made on my Bank of America Advantage Savings Account. I called Bank of America to report that I had not made/authorized this transaction. I filed a claim to get my money back as this transaction was still pending and I was told that the process would take 7-10 business days.

The representative stated that someone had gained access to my bank account using my username and password, and this person asked me to reset my username and password in order to prevent further fraud activity on my account. While speaking to the representative, I saw that there were two more transactions being made on the same Savings account : the first being a transaction for {$4300.00} under the name XXXX XXXX Credit Card ending in XXXX, and the second transaction for {$5400.00} under the name XXXX XXXX Credit Card ending in XXXX. These two transactions had been declined.

I called the Bank of America Fraud Claims Department ( XXXX ) several times between XX/XX/2019 and XX/XX/2019 to get updates on the status of the claim but was told that I would have to wait the full 10 business days before anything could be done. 

On XX/XX/2019, I reached out to the Bank of America Fraud Claims Department because 10 business days had passed since I had submitted my claim. I was surprised to hear that my claim had been denied on XX/XX/2019. Bank of America claims that this transaction had been performed from my device with the same IP address that I always use to access my Mobile Banking Application. I reinforced that I had not made this transaction and that I do not even have any Credit Cards accounts with XXXX or XXXX XXXX. The Bank of America Fraud Claims representative told me that this denial decision was final, unless I could bring forth evidence that my phone had been hacked with a virus or malware at the time of the fraudulent transaction. 

The representative then advised my to speak to my phone provider ( XXXX ) to run a virus scan on my XXXXXXXX XXXX device. I visited two XXXX stores and both claimed that they do not run such virus scans. I reached out to the Bank of America Fraud Claims Department again to inform them of this. Another representative then advised me to visit a XXXX location near me to run a virus test on my device. I followed the representatives instructions and went to a XXXX location and after purchasing an anti-virus software, I was informed that there were several viruses on my device that the software was able to remove. I faxed a letter from the XXXX technical department to the Bank of America Fraud Claims Department to prove that my device had in fact been hacked. 

I called XXXX Customer Service to see if any fraudulent activity had been detected on my device. However, I was told that they could not detect any fraudulent activity on my account.

Since maybe XXXX I stated having more problems making my payments and when I first contacted them to see if I could get some help, I was they dont refinance, I started having problems because the building I was living was infested with mold and making me and my child sick. In moving my rent increased but I had not had a pay increase in three years. I worked for out local housing authority which is non profit. During this time I also started school to increase my changes at gaining higher pay which some of my schooling was coming out my pocket. After struggling to make my payments, on XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with Avid representatives and was told I could get deferment for one payment but my payments must be up to date. During this time, my employer was firing people left and right and I had to race to get a job. Here where I live, they dont keep people with proper KSOAs, they hire family and friends. I finally had to take another job which was less pay like {$200.00} less a month and I had to commute which meant more out of pocket such as gas, maintenance, oil changes are more frequent and trying to keep a roof over my head and pay my way through school so that {$200.00} really hurt to where Im borrowing money from friends for gas and have to pay that back. I never heard anything back about the deferment I submitted. They never sent anything in writing on if I was approved or not. When I mentioned this in a email, they said if I call them we can talk about it. In XXXX of XXXX, I made a XXXX dollar payment which was my school money and I have made payments after that which I found out they were planning to repo the car. Now I owe them XXXX after dropping that XXXX. I feel I am being taken because of my situation and feel Im getting punished. I told them I have paid off four other cars, the difference was the other company made it possible for us to make out payments by refinancing when we get into trouble out of our control. I have never heard of a company that dont refinance so the customer can be in control of their money and still live. I have a year left on this car, I told them I already know what they are going to do. They will set me up for failure then repo the car, I lose my job then they gon na want money. I have ask and explained what I was going through without success. Only thing I get from them is finger pointing and accusations about me not contacting them. Who do I talk to, I have like two and three people on my back either emailing me or calling all day. I have told them I cant answer my phone at work, we signed a document that we will not have our phones out. Right after work, I go feed my mom who has XXXX then class.

They want to know when Im going to pay the XXXX which I already to them in a email when Id be trying to make a payment. I can only it when I get my taxes and school money, this is keeping me from paying my medical bills and according to a budgeting specialist the car note needs to come down and they wont do it unless I refinance with someone else. This is not fair. I thought I saw a post on their reviews that they helped another person so what mays me different?

After multiple calls and letters, they refuse to work with me. I feel this is very unfair and does not reflect my excellent payment record. I am a cosigner on the total loss car and the new car. They sure didn't have a problem financing a new car for my daughter with me as a cosigner due to our repayment record. They did not even run a credit check because we were told there was no need due to our repayment record with the wrecked car, but they refuse to remove a late payment that I was unaware should have even been made. The car was a total loss. Insurance and gap should have covered the loan amount. We purchased another vehicle. Payment by insurance was still being negotiated along with canceled warranties. They applied those to the principal that left XX/XX/XXXX note unpaid. This was also the month we purchased the new car also through Nissan motor finance. I, the cosigner, was never notified of a balance or missed payment. Once I called to confirm gap payment, they informed me of XX/XX/XXXX missed payment. ( Again, I called them, they never called me. ) I immediately paid two installments which brought the car up to date and have continued to pay monthly while negotiating with insurance and gap. I have begged and pleaded due to circumstances for Nissan to remove the late payment remark they reported in XX/XX/XXXX, but they refuse. I do not understand. This will be on my record for seven years. That is not fair when before this, I had a 100 percent repayment record.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX XX/XX/XXXX To Whom It May Concern : Thank you for taking the time to read this letter, and I hope your day is going well. Im writing because I noticed that my most recent credit report contains a late payment reported on XX/XX/XXXX for an account that I am a cosigner on ( the XXXX XXXX XXXX acct # xxxxxxxxxxxxx. ) I want you to know that I understand my financial obligations, and if it werent for my daughter being involved in an accident that left her car a total loss, this would not have happened. Please review our payment history. We also financed another vehicle through Nissan based on our excellent credit. Acct # xxxxxxxxxxxx in XX/XX/XXXX. I thought that State farm and gap paid off the XXXX. I wasn't aware there was a balance on this account and I ( the cosigner ) was not notified of a missing payment or balance due. I have an excellent repayment record. I haven't had a late payment in over 8 years and it isn't fair that this will be on my record for 7 years as it does not reflect my repayment record accurately. I made a mistake in falling behind due to these circumstances but since then, the total loss account is up to date with no late or missed payment. I take responsibility but in 35 years of owning vehicles, I have never had this happen. I will set up auto payments or pay the loan off if necessary, to approve the removal of late payment. 

I am in the process of a construction loan and mortgage conversion and its come to my attention that the missed payment on my record has hurt my ability to qualify. My score in XX/XX/XXXX was a xxx. This late payment devastated my score and I truly believe that it doesnt reflect my creditworthiness and commitment to repaying my debts. It would help me immensely if you could give me a second chance and make a goodwill adjustment to remove the late payment posted on XX/XX/XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX payment.

This was highly concerning and put me in a good deal of duress. 

When I called the customer service line, at first they could not locate my account at all. After a period of time, I was informed that my savings account was a custodian account, technically a UTMA account created when I was a child, and due to a recent manual update, I no longer had the ability to view the account or make any actions related to this account. They informed me that this change occurs at the age of XXXX ; I am now XXXX XXXX XXXX and have had access to the account until XX/XX/2019. I received no notice in advance of this change, nor did my father, who they say is the custodian of the account and today still has control of the account. My understanding, after some research, is that I should have had full access to this account when I turned XXXX. 

I was made aware of an internal memo related to this issue. I asked for a copy of this memo or any other written document related to this change in policy, and I was informed that they can not provide anything in writing. I asked for a copy of the recording of the conversation and they were unable to provide it. I received a call from USAA tonight, XX/XX/2019, informing me of the same. 

This episode is very concerning to me.

In XX/XX/2019 I opened three savings accounts via an online application from their solicitation advertising an interest rate of 2.33 %. 

I funded the accounts using the Citibank process for account to account transfers from my credit union account in XXXX, NM by following the instructions from Citibank. The transfer of funds went well. 
On my first bank statement I received in XX/XX/XXXX I noticed Citibank was withholding for federal taxes with the information on my statement saying, "" Federal Withholding Tax Uncertified ''. 

I called Citibank inXX/XX/2019 and inquired about the withholding and was informed I need to submit a W-9 and they directed me to the IRS website to obtain the form. I asked how I could submit the form and was told to fax it in. I followed the directions and submitted the form via the fax number they provided. 

XXXX weeks later, I called Citibank and asked if the form was received. I was told by the Citibank representative the forms could not be faxed in and had to be mailed! I followed these contradictory instructions and mailed in the form to the address I was provided in early XX/XX/2019. I was told to wait three weeks for processing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called Citibank, and after a long wait on hold time, and after explaining the problem ( again ) I was transferred to their servicing department.

I left detailed information about my name, SSN, account numbers and the reason for my call. I left a daytime phone number and repeated the number, including area code three different times for clarity. No one ever called me back or took care of the issue of my interest being withheld. 

In early XXXX I received my bank statement and noticed interest was still being withheld for taxes, telling me they have not processed either of the forms I submitted. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Citibank and spoke with a representative and told them my story ( again ) and was told I need to talk with a supervisor. They placed me on hold and forgot about me.

On XX/XX/XXXX I called Citibank again and after entering all the information about my account on the phone and waiting through the phone menus, the message came on they are too busy to talk to me and told me to call back in two hours then they hung up on me.

334,2019-11-10 00:00:00,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Getting a loan or lease,Confusing or misleading advertising or marketing,"My daughter and son-in-law wanted to purchase a more recent model year vehicle since the vehicle they were in was old and unreliable/unsafe for their new baby. They attended car dealer Larry H. Miller 's Used Car tent sale on XX/XX/2019 for XXXX XXXX, at the XXXX expo center. They found a vehicle that they liked but due to having no credit score ( no debt or credit history ) they needed a co-signer. I drove to the tent sale on XX/XX/2019 to co-sign the loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. It was hot and stuffy and very busy with long lines of people waiting to close on their loans. This made Mr. XXXX hurry to rush along the paperwork signing. At no time while we were signing documents did the Finance Manager, XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX, disclose that due to this being an indirect loan that I would be the primary lendee, and not my daughter and son-in-law, ( XXXX and XXXX XXXX ). After the paperwork was finalized Mr. XXXX told us he would send the final loan documents via email. As of XX/XX/2019 we have not received the final loan documents. 

When the loan was originated with XXXX it showed up on my account, but not on my daughter and son-in-laws account. When the dealership was called to inquire why XXXX XXXX and XXXX did not have access to this loan on their XXXX account we were told that LHM Dealership submitted the paperwork correctly and the fault was on XXXX. When I spoke with Ms. XXXX XXXX, Indirect Lending Manager for XXXX, she explained that XXXX has a rule that the person with the credit score and credit history that signs for the loan is the primary. According to Ms. XXXX the only way to have the loan show on my daughter and son in law 's account is for them to be the primary loan holder. The only way this is possible, per Ms. XXXX, is to go to an XXXX branch and apply for a direct loan. 

Due to this misrepresentation and failure to disclose this fact by Mr. XXXX at LHM Auto Finance,  My daughter and son in law must now come back to Utah from Idaho to re-apply for a car loan and we must all re-sign paperwork, and my credit will be pulled yet again ... If the difference between indirect and direct loans had been disclosed at the time of purchase we would have chosen to go to an XXXX   branch to secure a direct loan. 

I called Mr. XXXX and he claimed that he had told us that I was the primary. Funny how 3 adults signing paperwork all heard differently. When I sat down with Mr. XXXX, I said, "" I am here to co-sign on a car loan ''. He never batted an eye or stated anything contrary to that. 

I called LHM and spoke to the General Sales Manager, Mr. XXXX XXXX. He told me the reason I was the primary on the loan was because I was the one with the credit score and if I wasn't the primary, my daughter and son in law would pay a higher loan rate. Ms. XXXX contradicted that statement. Mr. XXXX also said he didn't know what I wanted him to do about it. 

I am not sure if this is a TILA violation but LHM Finance Manager XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX failed to disclose the difference between an indirect and direct loan, so we did not have all of the information to make an educated and informed decision. Their handling of this situation has been unprofessional, lacked any customer service and misrepresented the terms and type of loan we believed we signed.

339,9/30/2019,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Getting a loan or lease,Fraudulent loan,"To Whom it may concern, I am writing regarding my ongoing dispute with the company Credit Acceptance Corp. My Credit Acceptance account number is XXXX. I purchased a car ( a XXXX XXXX XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX   XXXX XXXX, the price of the car was {$6000.00} ( attachment 1 ). I put {$2000.00} down, as the lender Credit Acceptance dictated. The dealership added a lender fee of {$450.00}, making the amount to be financed {$4500.00}. 
As the salesman was going over the sales contract with me ( attachment 2 ), he advised me that if I kept the loan for the full 48 months, I would pay a total amount of {$6800.00} and that it would be in my best interest to pay off this loan as soon as possible. 
On XXXX XXXX at XXXX, I called Credit Acceptance to obtain a payoff balance and was advised that amount was approximately {$6500.00}. I immediately advised the company that amount could not be correct. The company representative became belligerent and condescending. I advised the rep that I would like to file a dispute. The representative told me that he submitted my dispute and forwarded it to the complaint resolution department and that they would call me at a later date. 
I immediately called the auto dealership and spoke with the manager, XXXX. XXXX advised me that my figures were correct on the sale price of the car, and emailed me proof the cost ( attachment 1 ). XXXX was not able to provide a reason why the salesman entered the incorrect amount in the cash price box on the agreement that I did sign. XXXX also went to her accounting department and provided me with a copy of the payment from Credit Acceptance to XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  in the amount of {$4500.00} ( attachment 3 ). In addition, XXXX phoned Credited Acceptance to try to fix this error, but was told that I would be responsible for the amount entered into the cash price box of the contract AND further interest and fees on that amount. 
With an already excessively high interest rate of 28 %, paying that rate on an additional and incorrect {$4000.00} is obscene, abusive and predatory. I have paid my monthly payments on time, every month without postponing a single payment. See attached payment history ( attachment 4 ) which includes additional interest charged to me. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from XXXX in the conflict resolution department of Credit Acceptance. During this 8 minute and 55 second call, she advised me to send in what documentation that I had to prove my dispute. I emailed my documents to her that evening and she returned my call the next day ( this call lasting 1 hour and 13 minutes ). XXXX said that based on the information that I submitted, there was a discrepancy but that they would not be making any changes to my account and the dispute was closed. During this call, I also spoke with supervisor XXXX, who also disregarded all of the documents that I submitted and advised that there would be no changes to my account. 
I have sent many emails and talked with XXXX  several times since then. I have not received a single written or email reply from this company. When I speak with XXXX on the phone, she hangs up and ends the conversation before all of my questions are answered. I have sent several email requests for the company to perform a real and actual investigation to no avail. I have asked for a written ( at least ) summary of their investigation and have been refused. 
During my phone calls with XXXX, I have been given deflective and deceptive answers to questions. For example, when I asked XXXX how many payments that I have made on my account, her answer was about 17, or maybe 20 to 25. When I asked her to add up the funds that I have sent in on all of my payments combined, her answer was well, if you financed {$8500.00} and your balance is now {$6500.00}, then you have paid in about {$2000.00}. When XXXX asked me if I had proof of what the car was selling for, I said yes, I have already sent this to you. Her reply was that is not a Credit acceptance contract, and then she promptly moved to another topic completely disregarding my answer AND the proof that she requested. 
I have made 17 payments for a total of {$4300.00} and been charged {$2300.00} in interest. All based on an incorrect sales price. I need to have my account recalculated with the correct sales price in place, and a financed amount of {$4500.00}. 
If I had a loan for {$4500.00} with an interest rate of 28 % and total payments of {$260.00} per month, the total payoff over the length of the loan should be {$5800.00}. However, for a loan on the amount of {$6800.00} the total payments for the life of the loan would be {$11000.00}. Credit Acceptance only paid {$4500.00} to the dealer for the car ( see attachment 3 ). They are requesting that I pay approximately {$5500.00} in invalid fees. 
All that I am asking for is what is fair, just and right. I would like an accurate balance on my account, so that I may pay off the car. I am not asking for a reduction in their abusive interest rate, nor even any sort of refund at this time, if my payments have over paid what I in actuality owe on this car. If, however, Credit Acceptance attempts to drag this dispute out and there is a large over payment on my part, I will ask to recoup that loss, with an interest rate of 28 %.

If Credit Acceptance insists that I pay on a loan of {$6800.00} with an interest rate of 28 %, and they only paid {$4500.00} to Incredible Auto, then I need them to make a payment to me in the amount of {$2300.00} plus 28 % interest for 16 months. This payment would insure that they would not be guilty of fraud.

357,9/21/2019,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"My complaint concerns TD Bank. I have been a customer in the XXXX area since XXXX, with checking, savings and credit card products. In XXXX of XXXX, I went in to my branch to update my Savings account to one with the best interest rate ( from their 'High Yield Savings Account ' to their 'TD Select Savings Account ' ). The savings account I chose had tiered interest rates based on the account balance, and a 'rate bump ' ( a higher band of interest rates at every tier for having additional linked accounts, like their Visa credit card ). I fulfilled all the requirements for their best interest rate, and left satisfied with the product I had signed up for. Since XXXX of XXXX, I have periodically monitored the interest rates by going to the TD Bank web site, and was pleased to see that they remained reasonably competitive. However, when I recently did the math based on interest credited to my account, I discovered that I was getting far less than the posted rate. This led to numerous phone calls and a trip to my local branch to try and get the issue addressed. No one at the bank or on the phone was able to accurately explain or resolve my problem, but I managed to piece together the following scenario ... 

In XXXX of XXXX, mere weeks after I opened my 'TD Select Savings Account ', they grandfathered ( retired ) this account  product and did not notify me. It was 'replaced ' with a product called the 'TD Preferred Savings Account ' with essentially identical features to the 'TD Select Savings Account ' ( including the tiered interest rates and rate bump features ). To my best understanding, the only thing that changed for this product is the name. When TD grandfathered my 'TD Select Savings Account ', they essentially froze the interest rate at the XX/XX/XXXX level, but the 'TD Preferred Savings ' rates ( advertised prominently on their website ) rose steadily as competition in the savings account market increased over the past couple years. Even worse, it is impossible to find information on the current rates and tiers for my 'TD Select Savings Account ' without making a special request - so this is  clearly an active suppression of information. I can not view this as anything other than a 'bait and switch ' scheme. Without telling their customers, they changed their product used to advertise their savings account rates and replaced it with something identical in all but name, but with lower interest rates. Not even their customer service representatives were able to easily spot the difference! In my case, this was mere weeks after I opened the account. Given that I keep all my emergency funds in this savings account, it has resulted in a significant loss of interest income over the past 2 years. I have talked to the store manager at my local branch, and multiple banking representatives at the branch and through their 24/7 phone support, and no one is willing to acknowledge wrongdoing or correct the issue in any way.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,MA,021XX,None,Consent provided,Web,9/21/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3382045

However, contacting GLS is extremely difficult and results in inaccurate, incomplete and none resolved issues. I initially revived a call from GLS regarding a welcome call from XXXX. However, I was unable to talk for 7-10 minutes and asked for a return call but was denied a number to call them back on. XXXX stated that I needed to just dial the number that showed up on my call id. Unfortunately, unknown caller was the message received instead of an actual number. The welcome call was finally completed via XXXX a funding manager but the next issue was verifying my insurance. I provided all the information to XXXX but somehow it was not uploaded or documented as such but getting back in touch with XXXX to resolve the issue was not possible. Despite several calls and attempts I never received a return call from anyone at GLS. The problem is now making payments. The car payment is due on the XXXX ( today ) or XXXX ( tomorrow ) of the month and I have no information on how to make a payment. I called again today and was simply told by XXXX that, its my responsibility to make a payment and do what I need to do to get the information. She informed me that the application was completed at the end of XXXX ( no date was given ) which is maybe the reason why I havent received the welcome package because that takes 7-10 days after its completed. She also stated that the person that did my welcome call should have explained all of this to me. However, when I spoke to XXXX, I was told that the information would be mailed out but that was almost a month ago and I havent been able to reach him since.

399,2019-08-08 00:00:00,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"I apologize in advance because this complaint is years in the making. I will do my best to give you as much detail as possible but please understand that because this has been going on for 4 1/2 years I can't give you specific dates on everything. 

Let me start out by saying I am a XXXX military veteran. Part of my XXXX is XXXX problems. I don't say this to garner sympathy, but to inform you that I did serve my country proudly and am hurt by how I'm being treated by my credit union who I thought was supposed to help me. Many years ago while I was still on XXXX XXXX, I bought a XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX. I bought it from a dealer named XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Everything went well because I already was approved for a loan through Navy Federal Credit Union. Everything went well until I went to the XXXX DMV in NY the next day to try and register the vehicle. The DMV told me they couldn't register the vehicle under my name because I didn't have a title. After I found out about this, I called Navy Federal to find out if they had the tile so I can register the vehicle under my name. Navy Federal told me they didn't. I then tried calling the dealer I bought the car from but I never once received an answer. Because I was XXXX XXXX, I was not able to follow up on this for about a week but once I did that's when things hit the fan. 

When I get my next off-duty days, I go back to the dealer I bought the vehicle from. The dealer was nowhere to be found. I mean the entire dealership and not just the salesman. The entire lot was empty and it looked like a ghost town. At this point I am stressing out and I am wondering what's going on. I call Navy Federal and I ask them if they ever received the title for this vehicle to which they told me no. Now I have a vehicle that is not under my name, and that I won't be able to drive because the license plate is temporary. I couldn't even insure the vehicle. I then head to the XXXX XXXX Police Department to begin an investigation and truth be told no one wants to help me out. I seemed like a nuisance to them and nothing ever really got done. Because I was getting nowhere, I called Navy Federal Credit Union and ask what can I do to have this loan undone because I now had a vehicle that I could n't drive, couldn't register under my name, and whose title was nowhere to be found. In their own words they essentially tell me, too bad so sad. Over the next few weeks I talk to Navy Federal at least 2 more times wondering how I can get out of this loan but they didn't help me at all and told me I'm going to have to pay for the loan no matter what because they lent me the money. 

From that point I stopped driving the vehicle because it wasn't registered to me and I couldn't register it without the title. Navy Federal never obtained the title so I was not going to drive a vehicle that was not mine and had no tags. Furthermore, if I got into an accident, I didn't want to be liable for damages since I couldn't even insure the vehicle. Because of this, the vehicle was literally parked in the yard at my residence for three years. Throughout all those years I paid on the loan to Navy Federal because I didn't know what to do and Navy Federal never helped me with anything. XXXX came and I was going to be moving to California as I was no longer in the service and wouldn't have a home. I didn't know what to do with the vehicle that I could n't drive so I made a last ditch effort and headed to the XXXX Police Station and see if there was anything more that could be done. Thankfully, the police officer helping me at that station was a good officer. He did a real investigation and found out that the vehicle I purchased was a stolen vehicle. He even found out who the prior owner was. The police called the previous owner and asked if they still wanted the vehicle. The previous owner told them no. Once the police department deemed the vehicle no longer needed to be registered as stolen, they removed the stolen status of the vehicle and made it so I could finally register the vehicle under my name. This was either in XXXX or XXXX of XXXX. I started the process but unfortunately it was too late for me to be able to obtain the tile anymore as my departure for California had arrived. I was forced to leave the vehicle with a friend named XXXX as I could not risk driving it across the country with 3 year old tags, no insurance, and no registration. Keep in mind at this point I have already paid 3 1/2 years for a vehicle that was stolen and has never been legally mine. 

Once I got to California, I eventually ended up getting the title to my vehicle. I start making plans to register the vehicle in my name, insure the vehicle, and pick it up from XXXX. However, the same time I got my registration sent to me by mail, my friend XXXX calls me and tells me my vehicle has been stolen. It feels like it happened the exact same time. I call Navy Federal to tell them what happened but as they told me before many years prior, too bad so sad. You have to pay for this vehicle loan. Even after all this I continued to make payments faithfully until about 2 months ago. Truth be told, I can no longer afford it. 

Because I feel like I've been taken advantage of, and because nobody else would help me, I finally reached a company that had a good reputation from all the reviews I've seen. I told this company about my situation and they were very honest with me in telling me they are unsure if they could help me but that they would attempt to assist me If I chose to enlist them in their aid. They said I would be their guinea pig  since they had handled cases that resembled my problem but not one specifically like it. I agreed since they were the only ones willing to help me and they seemed honest so I decided to let them get involved. Well I thought I had a hard time with Navy Federal but these guys had it worse. 

My representatives by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX started calling Navy Federal and sending power of attorney by mail. After a month they received no response of any kind by Navy Federal. I go back to XXXX XXXX XXXX office on XX/XX/XXXX and they call Navy Federal in front of me. In that conversation, representatives from navy Federal don't seem like they know what they are doing. They are asking my representative questions like, "" what department do you want to send the power of attorney to '' and "" what account are you sending the power of attorney for? '' After letting them know he wants Navy Federal as a whole to have the power of attorney on file and not just one department they finally end up giving him a fax number of XXXX. They also give him an address of XXXX power of attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Fl XXXX. My representative re-mails the poa and faxes the poa to them on the XXXX of XXXX. By the XXXX of XXXX, he receives another call from a representative asking him the same question as before, "" what department do you want to send this to? '' Please keep in mind that my representative has been trying to forward them power of attorney since XX/XX/XXXX in order to begin discussing the situation to him and he is still receiving these ridiculous questions and I am still waiting for progress to be made. He finally tells the representative that he is surprised a large organization such as Navy Federal is having trouble figuring out what they are supposed to be doing with a power of attorney especially since they have the conversation with him as well as his intentions recorded and noted down. 

By XX/XX/XXXX, I came back to XXXX XXXX XXXX to get another update as to what's going on. We call Navy Federal Credit Union together again and this is when all XXXX broke loose. We were on the phone for over 50 minutes. We were transferred and put on hold numerous times. They were trying to find out if they even had authorization to speak with him. My representative informed them how he had been forwarding power of attorney numerous times and now was starting to understand why he was reached for assistance by me. Finally a Navy Federal employee informed him that they did receive the power of attorney and it was accepted, but that the employee couldn't see it in her system. She was going to reach out to another department to figure out what's going on. When she came back she was asking for more time to "" activate '' the Power of Attorney. I was getting visibly upset so my representative pressed on and informed Navy Federal that we needed to speak to someone now or I would file this very complaint I am now filing. He was not going to accept that Navy Federal noted they received POA and accepted POA but that they needed more time because they were having IT issues. After the 25 minute mark, we reached another representative in the collections department. 

Miss XXXX is the representative in the collections department. Once he reached her he began describing the situation from the very beginning. The beginning being me being sold a stolen vehicle from a shady auto dealership. He described the situation of everything that I went through in not being able to register my vehicle because I didn't have the tile and nor did Navy Federal. He described how when I reached out to Navy Federal for help I was basically told I had to pay for the loan no matter what happened. He described how here I am 4 1/2 years later and thousands of dollars poorer for a loan that should have never been allowed to continue. He then begins asking several questions about when the loan originated, when title was received by Navy Federal, and several others. Miss XXXX begins telling him that she doesn't know the answer to most of these but offered to settle the debt and send us to the settlement department. We were then put on hold again. 

When Miss XXXX comes back, she confirms to us that title for this vehicle was not obtained until XX/XX/XXXX! This is 3 1/2 years after the loan originated. My representative asked her straight up "" Do you see a problem there? '' Miss XXXX said "" I do, I do see a problem there. '' She then said the loan was transferred to a signature loan. My representative then begins asking more questions and Miss XXXX continues to answer several of them with I don't know. She also kept saying on numerous occasions that she doesn't feel like she was very helpful. Finally when the conversation is almost over Miss XXXX turns on her collector mode switch and the conversation begins to turn sour. She asks my rep if I had kept in touch with Navy Federal about the situation. Obviously I did and he tells her as such but then she begins quoting the number of calls I've made to them supposedly. She lists 3 calls I've made since XXXX and then says that's all the calls I've made and not once did I tell them about the stolen vehicle. She then begins to attempt to establish that I never told them this vehicle was stolen but my representative was not having it. He tells her its highly unlikely I've only spoken to them only 3 times since there was communication at the beginning of the loan. Finally she clarifies that I only spoke to collection 3 times. 

My representative then says he understood I only spoke with collections 3 times but that Navy Federal as a whole had received numerous calls from me. Again she said she didn't know anything about that and then began to get really aggressive. She informed my representative that she was going to terminate the call because she didn't feel comfortable that my representative was asking her questions she didn't know the answer to. She then began raising her voice and interjecting and speaking over my representative. Finally my representative terminated the call himself as she was being belligerent and he was not going to get anywhere from that point on. 

I am filing this complaint because I don't know what else to do. I have been paying for a vehicle that I have never been able to claim as my own since the very beginning. This is not an I wrecked my car and don't want to pay for it anymore or my car broke down and its too expensive to fix so I don't want to pay for it anymore type of claim. This is literally an I never owned my car from day 1 and have been paying for the vehicle for 4 1/2 years without being able to use it. This is a my credit union funded a loan and never unwound the loan or got their money back once they found out I couldn't get title or register the vehicle, insure the vehicle, or transfer it under my name with them as the lienholder. This is an I asked my credit union for help and have been met with a cold shoulder and asked to pay a loan when they know I was ripped off from the beginning complaint.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,CA,933XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-08 00:00:00,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3333718

402,2019-08-10 00:00:00,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Getting a loan or lease,Changes in terms mid-deal or after closing,"I traded in my car about a year ago. I test drove a few vehicles and the salesman asked if I can get you into that with a payment around {$300.00}, do we have a deal. I said yes, thats a big if. 
The dealership was unable to come even close to the monthly payment I was comfortable with. I requested to leave and stated I just wanted keep my car several times. The salesman and the finance manager double teamed me for an extremely high pressure sale. Over the course of about 3-4 hours, I finally agreed to a finance plan suggested by the finance manager. It was almost double what I wanted to pay monthly, but he proposed that instead of putting a down payment, that I put that money in a savings account instead. He explained each month, I could take {$XXXX} out of savings to put towards my monthly payment, that way I didnt feel like I was over extending my budget. He promised in one year, I could come back when my credit score was higher and they would get me refinanced. I didnt want any add on policies to the loan, but the finance manager wouldnt stop pushing the auto warranty. He kept doing calculations and asking what if it only increased your monthly payment by $ x? 
I finally agreed to one that was an increase of around $ XXXX/month ( I dont remember the exact amount ). I signed all the paperwork. The vehicle was delivered to me with an empty gas tank and low pressure in all four tires. It was very late and I had spent the entire day at the dealership within food, so I didnt notice until I left the lot. A couple days later, I went to add the vehicle to my auto insurance and was surprised that I couldnt find the name of a lender. In the mean time, I kept getting notifications of hard credit pulls from my credit monitoring account. I called to ask about the lender and was told they hadnt secured financing yet, which was very strange. A few days later, I was asked to come back to sign loan paperwork. At that time, I told them I dont want the extended auto warranty. 
When I arrived to sign papers, I asked if he received my message about deleting the extended warranty. 
He stated that actually a lot had changed and in order to get the financing, the lender was requiring gap insurance and an extended warranty. I was told that the interest rate was XXXX  % higher and in order to make the deal work, they had to lower the sell price of the vehicle. I asked if I could have my car back and was told they didnt have it. 
I felt trapped, as now my only options were to sign the loan papers for this car or walk away with no car. 
I signed the documentation and I have been paying on the vehicle faithfully for a year. I have maintained it, including spending $ XXXX+ on recommenced maintenance when required. All maintenance has been done at the dealership. 
My credit score increased by XXXX points. Ive tried to refinance the vehicle and Im not able to because the loan amount exceeds the value of vehicle by too much. I cant trade in the vehicle either. I dont want the high payments any more and I dont want the vehicle. I never wanted it. I was pressured into buying it and I was pressured to agree to loan terms that I didnt originally agree to. 
I recently learned that its not legal to require a buyer to purchase additional insurance and warranties. I inquired about the legalities if this on a phone call with the lender. The rep stated its their right to protect their investment by requiring certain coverages. I asked him if they knew it was it was illegal to require it and he didnt have much to say. 
I reviewed my purchase contract and it explicitly states no additional coverages are required for the purchase. I wish I had known this at the time. Ive recently requested the dealership cancel both policies. The finance manager emailed me a cancellation form, which I completed and faxed to the number on the form. I emailed to ask for confirmation the fax had been received and processed. No answer, so I emailed again. The reply was that the fax went to a different office and that if I had turned in all the required documentation with the fax, the request would be processed. I immediately reviewed the previous emails and the cancellation form for instructions on additional documentation and there was none. I emailed again to ask what the required documentation was and I received no reply. Ive also made attempts to speak to the general manager about this issue and someone left me a voicemail on behalf of the XXXX.

We had agreed on a price of {$20000.00} with a loan amount of {$18000.00} ( after a {$2000.00} down payment ). My husband and I both filled out the credit application. The dealer contacted us soon after our credit application was filed demanding more paperwork from my husband- pay stubs, proof of employment, questions about his recent immigration status and our marriage. The dealer said they could not confirm his new temporary social security number. We told the dealer that my husband had legally obtained and used his social security number to find employment and obtain a driver 's license. Finally the dealer agreed that they had enough information and were going to go ahead with the loan. I was doing a final inspection of the car outside of the dealer 's office for about 5 minutes while my husband stayed inside speaking with the dealer. When I returned the dealer had changed the conditions of the deal demanding more documents and stating we would not be able to get the car loan until we provided the extra documents. With this change in the deal and the apparent interrogation of my husband while I was outside, resulted in us withdrawing our credit application and not buying the car.

We always did our due diligence and we had worked out a payment plan and had been paying each month with not problem. We had been told that the only way we could pay would be to call in, which we had no problem with. XX/XX/2019 is when things went downhill. We called as we always do to pay our bill and had on hold in the que for over a hour so because of work, we decided to try again another day. As we continued to call with no answer we assume it was because of the holiday season that they had been busy or closed. On XXXX XXXX at XXXX we received a voicemail from Td bank regarding our bill. Due to being at work we missed the call but returned the call the same day before office hours were over. We waited on hold for a while even while driving back home from work and never got anyone. We tried calling other reference numbers mentioned online in hopes that we would get the automated payment line as we had done multiple times before but the automated messages never brought us to that prompt they still have that option. I assumed since it was almost closing, no one was answering the phone anymore so we again tried the next day. Eventually after waiting for so long the automated System would say Our office hours are ... our website is ... goodbye and just hang up. Because of this message we assumed that it was due to the holiday hours. Again, we dont have a way to pay online. On XXXX XXXX after the holidays we tried calling again and was told our account has been turned over. XXXX XXXX we received a call from XXXX saying that they now had our account. We explained the situation to them and the guy proceeded to be rude and assault us. He told us there was no other option then to pay our balance within 30 days or they would take us to court. He proceeded to ask personal questions about why we went out of the country and if we had family that could pay our debt and he threatened to take wages from us if we didnt either pay the full balance in 30 days or do a {$4000.00} payoff within one week. We asked about a payment plan and he refused and said they will just take us to court. In all honesty, we can not give what we dont have. We have always paid all of our bill with every company weve ever been with so this is a first for us. We are honest people and want to pay our debt but rude remarks and threats were unnecessary. We called td bank again that same day asking why they had turned us over when weve always paid. The lady told us that she didnt understand why they would have since it had not been 30 days since our due date.

After speaking with several representatives there they informed me that our maturity date was XX/XX/2019 and we have 90 days after that to get the final payment made to gain ownership of the vehicle. My husband and I worked out a payment plan that fit our budget to get this vehicle paid off. Our final payment date should be no later than XX/XX/2019 from what the last rep provided us with.

Once I got the alert I contacted the company again asking why was it a mark on our credit? The rep then stated well yes we give you 90 days after the maturity date but every month after XXXX you will have a derogatory mark on your credit and when the final payment is posted it will show paid off in a delinquent status due to not paying it off on the XXXX maturity date. After expressing how frustrated I was with the company and the lack of information being given all they could say is they understand and apologize for no one telling us if the car wasn't paid off by the maturity date it will show late every month for the following 90 days. These lines are supposed to be recorded so us a customers have to suffer with the negative impacts on our credit due to the company employees not telling us what to expect for us not paying it off by the maturity date and using their next option of paying it off within 90 days afterwards. This doesn't impact anyone credit other than my husband and I, this was a very bad business practice and I will never want to do business with them ever again. I'm glad I know this now because I have another veh due to mature early next year and I now know to work to get it paid off before the maturity date and not use the 90 days after that they advertise so they can collect more money and ruin our credit more.

Nothing has been done and I have another regular payment of {$330.00} due on the XXXX, which I should not have to make because my large payment of XXXX should cover about 33 payments into the future. 

They will not acknowledge they have my {$11000.00}. 

I want to rattle their cage. Please help.

We first leased this vehicle from XXXX in fall of XX/XX/XXXX, a three year lease which meant it came off lease in XX/XX/XXXX. Late XX/XX/XXXX, we started working with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) to purchase the vehicle. Mid-XX/XX/XXXX we started working with Alliant Credit Union ( ACU ) to finance the vehicle purchase. Its been downhill from there. 
Our existing rate on the loan is 3.74 %, but we are being threatened with a 24.000 % Punitive rate by Alliant Credit Union over issues with the vehicle title. 
Chronology is below, we have been very proactive and engaged since the beginning in doing our part to fulfill the title transactions, but problems on both the XXXX and Alliant ends have us 120+ days in without the title processed. 
XX/XX/XXXX Receipt of XXXX paperwork, returned by us XX/XX/XXXX and received at XXXX on the XX/XX/XXXX. This mailer included all signed directives regarding the title. 
XX/XX/XXXX Alliant sends us their paperwork, returned by us XX/XX/XXXX. This mailer includes all signed directives regarding the title. Their letter to us states : After your packet is delivered to us, we will send you an email to confirm that weve received it. If you dont receive a confirmation email from us after one week XX/XX/XXXX We receive our end of sale XXXX mailer, which their cover memo indicates it is the final paperwork on their end of our vehicle purchase transaction. This includes a Bill of Sale, that shows amongst other things the Sales Tax paid in the transaction. 
XX/XX/XXXX Having heard nor seen anything from ACU on their end of the transaction at all ( besides their automated withdrawals of our loan payments ), we begin the first of MANY contacts by us to them inquiring as to the status by Secure Messaging in their app., by phone call, by fax, and by regular mail. ACU does not meaningfully or substantively respond to any of these. 
XX/XX/XXXX XXXX mid-XXXX transaction with our states Department of Motor Vehicles ( DMV ) to renew the expiring license plate sticker and vehicle registration is rejected due to titling issues. This is the first time and first notice to us that there is a problem. She then spends hours visiting the DMV, calling XXXX, and calling ACU to research. She follows ACU Lending Manager XXXX XXXX instructions to the last detail on what form is allegedly needed from XXXX to resolve. 
XX/XX/XXXX - Upon receipt of the XXXX paperwork that ACUs XXXX stated was required to complete this titling, XXXX visits the DMV and is again rejected. She again spends multiple hours talking with the DMV, calling XXXX, and calling ACU. Allegedly per ACU, XXXX indicates XXXX will not release the title over unpaid sales taxes. ACU Title Services telephones XXXX back on XX/XX/XXXX and indicates they and XXXX  have spoken and this should be moving forward. 
XX/XX/XXXX We receive a form letter First Notice from ACU dated XX/XX/XXXX threatening us with the punitive 24.000 % interest rate on our loan. 
XX/XX/XXXX We receive a call from ACU Title Services asking if we want them to ship us the final paperwork including Title, for the DMV completion of the transaction. We affirm we would appreciate this, and receive said mailer on XX/XX/XXXX. We take the paperwork into the DMV on Friday, XXXX and are told by the DMV that XXXX requested a new title in their name on XX/XX/XXXX, so the title ACU sent us is null and void. 
XX/XX/XXXX We fax both XXXX and ACU with the current status, that is unable to move forward with DMV until the new title that XXXX requested on the same day ACU sent us the existing title is received. 
XXXX XXXX We receive an ACU letter dated XX/XX/XXXX indicating our rate will move to 24.000 % onXX/XX/XXXX. The letter is signed Member Engagement Office and is in response to both our XX/XX/XXXX Complaint to their CEO and our XX/XX/XXXX fax about the latest title problem. It is the first and only written correspondence from Alliant on this entire matter, besides the canned First Notice received in XX/XX/XXXX and the overnight package with the now unusable title. 

Alliant Credit Union issues : 1. Lack of engagement, lack of responsiveness to our multiple contacts and complaints. We should have known before XX/XX/XXXX and the  messenger ought not to have been the IL DMV that there was a problem. 
2. Mis-information from their Lending staff on what was/was not needed to address this issue and resolve it. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX issues : 1. Erroneously withholding critical documents over unpaid sales taxes when they had two months prior sent us final documents including Bill of Sale signing off on Sales Taxes paid.

430,11/20/2019,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"The Company, Hyundai Motor Finance states in my complaint that the company has closed the account, supposedly paid as agreed. Which is true. I never missed a payment or was late. In fact I paid off a 72 month loan ( which I took for a dealer low interest rate of 1.9 % ) in about two years. Apparently this angered them. So while they kept accurate records of my on-time payments, which of course they had to do, they punished me by listing my total balance owed for about two years by never reducing it, if fact the they kept my amount due at {$11000.00} and never reduced it when payments were made. 
Of course this damaged my credit rating and an examination of my account ( if they would show you ) would show that as a 20 Year XXXX Vet, I am not lying. To this day, years later, a look at my Hyundai records will show you exactly what they did. 
Now I'm not looking to make money off what I consider is just pure incompetence, but if they won't adjust my balance due, which is still harming me financially, I will bring suit. 
They refuse to say anything except the case is closed. But it's not closed and they know it. They are just to vindictive or incompetent or lazy to fix my payment balance.

I just kept getting the run around/miscommunication & told it was me who committed the fraud from a so called reputable bank that prides itself on integrity. 
Each meeting/called was only to delay the time so they could continue to deny replacement of the funds stolen by the offender. I provided the name of the offender/hacker as well with supporting documents such as police reports ; which where disgarded leaving my daughter'e saving depleted and now and overdrawn balance that has been referred to creditors harassing me. I just stopped utilizing the accounts ans was told by the US Bank branch manager that i would not be charged nor account closed because it was fraud related, which was not true & created debt and unwarranted negative reports on my credit. 
I then tried to go to two other branches who acted but then i referred back the branch that i initially opened my daughters accounts.

434,2019-07-11 00:00:00,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"SUMMARY OF COMPLAINT : I opened a joint savings account with my wife with Citibank appoximately XX/XX/2019. Citibank closed the account XX/XX/2019, apparently for missing documentation. Citibank promised to refund the deposits ( totaling over {$190000.00} ) within 10 business days. They have still ( as of XXXX XX/XX/2019 ) not returned any funds and have been either unwilling or unable to provide any path forward for us to be able to retrieve our funds. 

DETAILED COMPLAINT : Approximately XX/XX/2019 my wife and I opened a joint savings account with Citibank. In XXXX we made deposits totaling {$190000.00} into the account. I received a statement from Citibank showing deposits plus interest in the account totaling {$190000.00} through XXXX XX/XX/2019. Statement is attached. 

Next I received a letter from Citibank dated XXXX XXXX 2019 ( attached ) stating the application was incomplete due to either a missing signed signature card or possibly an issue with a credit agency. The letter stated the account was being closed and we would receive the previously deposited funds within 10 business days. 

I never received the funds and called on at least 3 occasions in XXXX 2019. I was told on each occasion that a check with the funds would arrive at our address within 7-10 business days. The check never arrived. 

On XXXX XXXX 2019 I called again and a Citibank agent said that the check had never been sent, despite the previous multiple assurances during previous phone calls in XXXX. She then provided new information and said that the check would not be sent to the address we used when we opened the account because we did not provide utility bills or other proof of address. This new information conflicted with the written correspondence from the letter XXXX XXXX, and conflicted with all of the information from the phone calls in XXXX when we were told the check would be sent in XXXX. 

I explained that my wife is XXXX XXXX military and we just moved to our address in North Dakota ( the same address used when we opened the account ) and that we live in base housing and our only utility bill is a single cable bill, and that we could also provide a copy of the first page of our lease with our current address. 

The Citibank agent did not know if this would suffice but asked me to submit the cable bill and the first page of our lease. I submitted that information via docusign on XX/XX/XXXX and Citibank confirmed receipt and said they would have a response within 10 business days ( see attached email ). 

I never received any further response from Citibank. I called them on two further occasions on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX to ask about the status and they were not able to provide any timeline for resolution or any remedy or other method for us to retrieve the funds. They stated the "" back office '' was still working on it but they were backed up and decisions from the back office were taking longer than usual. I asked for some written correspondence to update me on the status and still have not received that. The last response I received from them on XXXX XXXX was essentially verbal advice to just keep waiting. 

At this point, Citibank has refused to refund our deposits totaling over {$190000.00} for over three months since they initially notified us that they are closing our account in the letter dated XXXX XXXX. They have repeatedly given us false information as to the status of our refund. They either have not been willing or able to provide any path forward for retrieving our funds. They have repeatedly broken their own policy deadlines on their original correspondence from XXXX XXXX and from their email correspondence on XXXX XXXX. 

I do not know the status of our account or it's current value as it is unclear if it is accruing interest or if they are just holding it interest-free.

435,10/17/2019,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Getting a loan or lease,Fraudulent loan,"To whom it may concern : A loan was opened in my name with a forgery of my signature. After my recent discovery of this matter, I have taken appropriate steps to report it to XXXX County Police Department ( case # XXXXX ) and XXXX County Sherriffs Office ( case # XXXXX ). The police investigation reflects XXXX forged my signature. I have requested the bank to formally release me from liability and correct my credit report. Despite my efforts to resolve this matter with the bank, the bank refuses to appropriately consider my plea. Instead, I have been repeatedly referred to the branch manager and loan officer, who have attempted to stifle my efforts in order to cover their mistakes. Therefore, I am making this formal complaint to the CFPB. 

Loan number XXXXXX originated by Loan officer, XXXX, was created at the Synovus branch in XXXX, Georgia. The loan is in the name of XXXX ( husband ) and me. It is dated XX/XX/XXXX, in the amount of {$17000.00}. It calls for 36 payments of {$540.00} and is collateralized by a XXXX XXXX XXXX. As evidenced by the police investigation, my husbands father, XXXX forged my signature on the Credit Application ; Amount Financed Itemization Form ; and the Note, Disclosure and Security Agreement. I never gave him permission or provided him a Power of Attorney for him to do so. In fact, I did not know I had a loan until I recently pulled a credit report due to my pending divorce. I have never been to Synovus Banks XXXX branch until I personally notified the branch manager of the forgery in XX/XX/XXXX. I never saw or received any loan documents from XXXX, XXXX, or Synovus Bank. 

Further evidenced on the credit application is falsified information of my personal history regarding past employer and residence. The credit application states my 2nd Employer No. of Yrs. : 7, and, Present Address, box marked Rent for No. of Yrs. : 10. This  information is incorrect as I had no second employer at the time of loan origination nor have ever been employed at a job for 7 years. I also do not rent my present home. The number of years 10 is also incorrect as I have lived at my present home for 12 years as of XX/XX/XXXX. 

Therefore, Synovus Bank : 1. Does not have a valid note and security agreement, amount financed itemization form, and credit application due to my forged signature on each document. I was never given a chance to review and sign the documents. I never received copies of such agreements. The following excerpt from the documents shows that my authentic signature is required : The Note, Disclosure and Security Agreement states, SIGNATURES AND SEALS- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I HAVE SIGNED MY NAME AND AFFIXED MY SEAL THE DATE BELOW GIVEN. I AGREE TO THE TERMS SET OUT ON PAGE 1 THROUGH PAGE 7 OF THIS NOTE. I HAVE RECEIVED A COPY OF THIS DOCUMENT ON TODAYS DATE The Amount Financed Itemization form states, By signing, I acknowledge receipt of a copy of this Amount Financed Itemization on todays date. 
The Credit Application states, You authorize us to request one or more consumer reports, to check and verify your credit and employment history, and to answer questions others may ask us about our credit experience with you, and You certify that everything you have stated in this Credit Application and on any other documents submitted to us are true and correct to the best of your knowledge. 

2. Does not have a Power of Attorney providing XXXX the ability to execute loan documents in my name. 

3. Has violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by pulling a credit report without my authorization ( written or verbal ). The Credit Application ( which requires an original signature ) states, You authorize us to request one or more consumer reports, to check and verify your credit and employment history, and to answer questions others may ask us about our credit experience with you. Therefore, Synovus is in violation since I never authorized. 

4. Has reported this loan on my credit report, which negatively affects my ability to get additional credit. 

5. Has violated BSA/AML regulations because Synovus Bank did not perform mandatory customer due diligence and customer identification procedures. Since I did not participate in this transaction nor was there in person, they did not verify my identity through appropriate documents, such as State drivers license, etc. If this is a pattern or practice, then this would be a BSA pillar violation for Synovus Bank and subject the bank to supervisory enforcement actions and civil money penalties. 

Reflecting back, on or about the date of loan origination, I received a call from the loan officer, who requested my personal information such as DOB, Drivers License Number, and home address ; however, it was never communicated to me that I would be a signer on a loan. In fact, XXXX communicated to me that the vehicle was a gift to me and he would make full and complete payments on a loan they were getting. I was under the impression that XXXX and XXXX were the makers on a loan, so that XXXX could build his credit. I was never under the impression that my name and credit would be used to finance the car. Hence, XXXX took advantage of me since I am young and did not have any prior knowledge of the bank financing process. ( Again, Synovus Bank, XXXX, and XXXX did not provide me with any paperwork. ) Throughout our short marriage ( divorce is in process ), XXXX and XXXX failed to show me any loan documents regarding this matter and never discussed any information with me. All I knew was that the car was a gift to me, and XXXX financed the vehicle and would make all payments on it. This matter was never a topic discussed, which adds the impression of them keeping this hush-hush from me. My only knowledge was the car was a gift and I had no knowledge my name was cars note. 

Approximately 1-2 months after the loan origination, I received correspondence in the mail from Synovus Bank. Once received, I reached out to XXXX through text message that I received this book in the mail and that I will give it to him. I did not take time to look at it and did not give it a second thought. I had no idea what it was and why it was sent to my home address. ( From what I know now, it was a payment book that gets sent to the loan recipients from the loan issuer. ) Again, I was unfamiliar with loan processing and was not versed in financial matters of this transaction. 

In my last phone conversation in XX/XX/XXXX with the loan officer, XXXX, she stated that she had called me ( at or around loan origination ) to obtain my information, such as date of birth and drivers license number and had informed me of such credit application. She also complimented XXXX long history with the bank and that they had a good customer relationship. During the XX/XX/XXXX call, I again communicated to XXXX that she, XXXX, and XXXX never communicated to me that my information was being used to obtain a loan and that I would be liable on the loan. ( It seems their existing banking relationship facilitated the forgery. ) I ended the phone conversation by requesting my name be taken off the credit application and loan, but she refused. 

Therefore, I am making a formal compliant to CFPB to 1 ) formally document Synovus Banks poor lending practices to consumer s, 3 ) document Synovus Banks failure to act and correct this situation, and 3 ) request CFPBs intervention in resolving this matter. Considering my pending divorce with XXXX, I am afraid that I will be eventually liable for a fraudulent activity that was performed by XXXX and XXXX. As a soon-to-be divorced, young female with a young child and limited income, my ability to get credit is very important. I need this matter resolved immediately. Expressly, I need Synovus Bank to release me from any and all liability for this loan, remove any association of my name on these documents, and correct my credit report.

We talked and haggled for about 3 hours and after running my credit ( XXXX has record of this as well ) I had a XXXX credit score and the salesman ( XXXX ) said that with that credit score I would be getting financing through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, with an interest rate around 10 %, payments close to XXXX and qualified for there no payments for 90 days. ( Summer special XXXX XXXX verified that this was offered to people with my credit score ) however it was a Saturday and he said he would call Monday to have me come in and sign the documents. I was put off and passed around for approximately 35-40 days before I  contacted the MVED and was given to investigator XXXX XXXX. He got them moving and within 5 more days the loan was ready. However during this whole process they never paid off my trade in so I was getting blown up by my prior finance company for the XXXX, which the company ended up calling the dealership and forcing them to pay it off finally. Then I asked for my plates and they said they were still waiting from the DMV. Over the next 2 months they continued to put me off to the point I had to park the truck due to not having plates or a temp tag AND my car insurance dumped my truck for it not being in my name. Now I don't have insurance and they won't take me back at the great rate I had because of it and it's XX/XX/2019 AND STILL NO PLATES! then I started getting calls from XXXX XXXX around XX/XX/2019 saying I was 3 payments behind because I never got the 90 day special. I told them that it couldn't be since I had XXXX credit. They proceeded to tell me that the loan documents submitted to the on XX/XX/2019 said my credit was XXXX and I was past due and near repossession. I looked up my profile on XXXX  and found a total of 8 hard pulls 2 of which were Larry H Miller. ( Once on XX/XX/XXXX and once on XX/XX/XXXX ) so they ran the crap out of my credit over 30 days then reran it through the dealership and gave me a terrible loan that is XXXX dollars a month more expensive than was a agreed upon. And now in order to get insurance put back on it will go up to XXXX from XXXX a month for the truck.. the truck I couldn't even drive for the last 2 months. Oh and the trucks brakes were warped from day 1. I would have noticed exceot the engine brake was turned up to cover it. ( They have already agreed to repair these free of charge. ) This has screwed up my credit, finances and stressed my family out to no end not to mention I am dealing with severe health issues right now. XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and a bunch of other problems. This is totally unfair and not what I agreed upon and now it may force me and my family to lose everything over it.

Why 2 months since the payment due for XX/XX/XXXXis only for 1 pay and I was not late with my payment. 
3. When asked rep, how I would be assured that this issue would not be happening again, there were no answers .... I think this is unacceptable and a better solution needed to be putting in place in company policy. 
4. I want to send this whoever in charge of this company that I will never buy XXXX vehicles again.

I paid the vehicle off making final payment in XXXX and never received title. I moved from XXXX  to XXXX  in XXXX and requested title from Ally in XX/XX/XXXX, provided mailing address and was told 7-10 days. XX/XX/XXXX i still hadnt received title, called and was told it was lost in the mail and I would need to pay for replacement an amount in the {$300.00} range I requested release of lien and was denied as I refused to pay the {$300.00}. I then mailed letter from DMV,  original inspection report, application and a money order {$190.00} for XXXX registration fees to Ally and requested title be transferred with lien so the vehicle could be registered, and still today this has not been done. I have made several calls to Ally requesting transfer and title and I an told no due to an account balance but no one could ever give me a balance. Each call I initiated at least four, I am told title will be requested receive in 7-10 days and nothing, when I follow up there is a balance due but no amount. XX/XX/XXXX I mailed again the DMV letter, originsl application, and {$190.00} for DMV fees requesting again title be transferred. I initiated contact at least 4 times since then always told I need to pay a balance without an amount. XX/XX/XXXX, after I demanded someone resolve this issue and provide details, i was transferred to Collection department who told me no record of amount, but there is s balance due and someone would contact me in 3-5 days, never received contact. The vehicle has been sitting all this time as it can not be registered, with the exception of 2-21day use permits in XXXX and currently a 21 day use permit that expires XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a complaint with XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX received message from Executive Services department, returned call with message on XX/XX/XXXX and again on XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX received call and spoke with agent regarding my complaint. Provided details of my complaint and requested resolution including the title to my vehicle or a release of lien. During this conversation I provided details and VIN for the car so he could pull up the title information. He mentioned the same as all previous agents that there wasnt a balance he could see either. He stated he would contact his title department and get back to me. XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX he left message for my return call while I was at work. XX/XX/XXXX I returned his call and he informed me that the title was never sent because there was a balance due, I dont recall exact amount but in the {$1700.00} range. I disputed and asked for what and was told from the original balance. I asked for details and he told me he couldnt send what he had but could put something together. He then said that they received my request to transfer title with lien in XX/XX/XXXX, but they didnt, and they mailed me a letter XX/XX/XXXX explaining they needed the original application. He confirmed the letter was mailed to the wrong address, and confirmed he had the right address. I told him it was the original that was sent as well as the original inspection report and a money order for {$190.00} for registration fees. He could not confirm they had the physical documents sent due to the time period only that the system note said it was not the original. He said more than likely they no longer have the inspection report or money order either. He confirmed the numerous attempts Ive made to resolve and told me that no one could ever pull the information and provide the details due to the age of the account. He indicated the audio from past calls where I was told it was sent and there was no balance due were no longer available, and all he had was the notes he could find. He stated the information was hard to find and piece together. And, the balance had been turned over to numerous collection agencies over the years. He stated they did not have access to full the details due to the amount being charged off, and in order to obtain the title I would have to pay the amount due to an outside agency as they were no longer able to collect the payment. I told him I did not agree with the balance and that the last payment was made XXXX, and I never received a call, a letter or notice of the debt until now, with the exception of just being told there was a balance due. He said he would contact the title department to see what else he could do and find out if they had original documents to transfer the title so I could register the vehicle. The vehicle has sat for all but two months since XX/XX/XXXX when I operated the vehicle with 3 separate 21 day use permits. These permits each cost {$32.00}. The vehicle needs a full inspection as belts are squealing, tires, and fresh fluids as a direct result of sitting and currently is my only vehicle. The use permit expires XX/XX/XXXX.

Summarizing what was said to me, I was told because it was once re'poed there is really nothing they can do.

It was two different contracts for this deal. The first was a sign and had Gap coverage on the car, along with the paperwork that was signed that said we accept and purchase the gap for the car. The same paperwork the lender had, which was how they produce the policy number that they provide us. So for some reason unknown to us, the first contract which was already signed was voided.

Account # XXXX To Whom it may Concern, My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and I am writing due to the fact that I feel that I am being treated unfairly by BMO Bank. I took over a Company called XXXX XXXX XXXX back in XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX, NC. The XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX that he purchased through XXXX Bank was found to have an engine that was no good in the first month of his purchase. 
I had the engine replaced through a purchase warranty and I have been running the Company and making the truck payment since the first payment of the loan. I asked XXXX XXXX to contact BMO Bank back in XXXX to inform them of this change and to inquire about having the loan put into my name. BMO Bank stated they would not do that. I have continued to pay this loan, never late always on time and on two different occasions I felt that I wanted to expand my company and add another truck but BMO Bank the first time told me that they were confused with my paperwork, no further explanation and I was denied. The second time I inquired with BMO Bank regarding a loan to acquire another tractor they once again denied me this time because they said there was to many inquiries on my credit report and that my accounts were not in place long enough. 
The standard response you get from a Financial Institution when there is no real basis for the denial. I have now nor did I than have any negative issues on my credit report for at least the past XXXX to 5 years. I have not been late or missed any payments due dates in the past XXXX to 5 years. I have paid BMO {$1200.00} per month for the past XXXX to 5 years and never missed a payment and never have I been late. Yet the only response I have received from BMO Bank is no or nonsense about inquiries on my credit report or not having accounts long enough. Clearly anyone can see from my credit history that none of the reasons BMO bank denied me for has had any bearing on my ability to pay on time consistently and this can not be denied. I am scheduled to be released from the hospital around XX/XX/XXXX. Before I entered this hospital on XX/XX/XXXX. I had inquired with BMO Bank asking them for a ( 3 ) month waiver because I would be unable to work the truck. XXXX of BMO Bank explained that there is a process to be approved for this and she was not sure as to how long it would take for me to receive an answer. What XXXX was sure of is that my monthly payment would increase, my interest rate would also increase and there was one more increase that would take place if I were approved for the waiver. I asked XXXX what I needed to do to be considered and she responded that some documents would be sent out to me but now as I am unable to work, I have yet to receive those documents to be considered for the waiver. 
It is crystal clear that BMO Bank could care less about me or about me being one of their customers. It makes no sense that I am paying {$1200.00} dollars per month from this hospital bed when BMO bank could have granted me a waiver especially for a XXXX International PRO Star Tractor that I will have paid off in ( 9 ) months. I am now clear about who BMO Bank is, they send me an invoice to my home each month for {$1200.00} and after they receive my money they pretend they dont know me and want nothing to do with me. I get it!!! I am requesting assistance with being recognized as the consumer whom has diligently been paying on this loan since day one. I would like the three credit reporting agencies to be made aware by BMO bank, that I XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has been paying the {$1200.00} invoices that BMO Bank has been sending me since day one. BMO bank has unjustifiably said no to me about ( 2 ) loan applications and they had no problem with not even responding to my request for the waiver even though from my hospital bed I have had to pay them out of pocket on time each month. I feel that I had earned the three previous requests that I had made to BMO Bank. I dont believe that anyone even BMO bank can take from me the reality regarding whom has paid the note on the XXXX International PRO Star For the last four years and that I should get credit for my efforts. 
I am asking that the three credit reporting agencies be contacted by BMO Bank to inform them of my four years payment history that the credit bureaus know nothing about. I would like my four years of payment history to be reflected on my credit reports. Here is thanking you in advance for any assistance rendered in this matter In case there is any questions or confusion as BMO bank claimed before regarding the validity of my request please feel free to contact myself or XXXX XXXX.

My loan was through Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation. It was a disaster from the beginning. I went to make my first payment, and they had absolute no record of me, my car, or my account. So days were passing and I was so nervous I would be late for my first payment. I called at least ten times to the dealership to find out what was going on. Nobody k ew a y thing, and they explained the man who sold me the car wouldn't be back for three weeks. I had no choice but to wait, because I had no account with NMAC. So finally XXXX gets back, get talks with the manager, and they discovered the finance manager never submitted my paperwork. Now it's two months in at this point. So I was furious! They were extremely apologetic and said this is a one in a million chance of this happening. Now mind you, if k hadn't said anything, I could have had a free car! But I do the right thing. So that was straightened out and my account was created. I advised them that they better not charge me late fee. So fast forward to a month later I was on my lunch break at work. I ran to the gym, O my way back I got pulled over for not signaling. It was brought to my attention that my license was suspended from a ticket years ago. Now mind you, if I was suspended how did I get Insurance at the dealership through XXXX in my name?!?! So the police said they had to impound the car. They gave me a card with a handwritten shop that my car was being towed to. No such shop exists! For two weeks, at {$150.00} a day, I spent trying to find my car. Finally I called the dealer, explained what happened. They told me they would just buy the car back, and I would owe them {$1000.00} and they would resell it. They said it would not go on my credit, because of all the confusion I had with them, they would do the is for me. I was grateful and went on with my life. Well here we are, with this one my credit as a charge off! I called NMAC and they said they never picked the car up, in fact it was sold at an auction for {$9000.00} and I was responsible for XXXX XXXX.i explained the deal we had, and she said to call them.

At the XXXX XXXX XXXX there was a really nice 2018 XXXX limited edition truck that I was interested in getting so my boyfriend at the time talked to them about it and I filled out the credit application and they called back and told him that we would be able to do it and that the interest rate would be 7 %. So we headed down there to talk about it some more, they seemed very rushed to get me to sign the papers, honestly they were really pushy about the whole thing. So I signed the papers and we left, because they were rushing it and being so pushy about me buy this truck I didnt go over the paperwork in the Dealership, and this was my first time buying a vehicle so I didnt really know what I was doing and they took advantage of that. I was looking over the paperwork when I got home and noticed the interest rate wasnt 7 % like they had told me it was but it was instead 16.28 % and its financed through Chrysler Capital. After I found out how much the interest was we called the dealership and told them we wanted to bring the truck back because I didnt agree to that but they wouldnt take it back. {$41000.00} was they amount financed through them and after i will end up paying {$65000.00} for this vehicle. I have tried to talk to Chrysler Capital about this and they just told me I had to take it up with the dealership. My payments are {$870.00} a month and I can not afford that. I really struggle with making that payment and I have told them that and when I end up being late they call me sometimes 8 times a day and when I do answer and try to tell them whats going on sometimes they have been pretty rude to me about it. It honestly feels like harassment. I lost my job and it took me a couple months to find another one that paid decent then I got kicked out of my house and I had to find a new one so now I have rent and bills and have to buy food and I really struggle with this, its either pay the payment or be homeless and starve and if I pay the payment then I dont have enough money for food or my house and I will be homeless and starve. I have told them this and they wont do anything to help me. If I lose this vehicle then I wont be able to make it to work, its just be all on my own and I think that they have really pretty much screwed me over. I think that the reason they made the interest rate so high is because they were the only ones that agreed to finance my vehicle and they knew that so they knew I didnt have any other option. They did give me one extension for the two months I didnt have a good paying job but that didnt give me any time to be able to catch back up.

510,9/30/2019,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"Hi, I opened Savings Account # XXXX with Citi Bank on XX/XX/XXXX through the online channel. During the Account opening process I clearly identified myself as a Not Subject to Tax Withholding. 

On XX/XX/XXXX the account received the first credit of monthly interests. No taxes were withheld. Good so far. 

On XX/XX/XXXX the account was credited with its second credit of monthly interests. In this occasion Citibank withheld {$22.00} of Interests. This is incorrect. I am not subject to Withholding and I identified myself as such during the account opening process. 

I contacted CitiBank on their customer service line ( XXXX ) to ascertain the situation. A representative explained over the phone that I had not yet sent my W-9. However, the Tax Status Identification and Certification process I completed at the opening of the account should have sufficient for CitiBank to properly document and validate my withholding status. T The representative informed me that I could sent my W-9 by regular mail or by fax. I chose Fax, which is easier. I sent my first W-9 by fax ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX. I called in the next day to validate that it was received and processed. The representative informed me it could take up to 2 weeks to process. Just in case, I repeated the process and sent daily faxes on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. In total I sent my W-9 on 10 different occasions to the Fax number provided. 
I called in again on XX/XX/XXXX to validate that they had received and processed my W-9. They informed me that they had not received it. This was very frustrating. I validated and confirm that the fax provide was the correct number. 

Again, I kept send daily faxes on XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX. Four ( 4 ) additional faxes. I called again on Monday XX/XX/XXXX to validate the status of this process. They informed me that they only had records of having received my tax form on XX/XX/XXXX. And it would take 2 weeks for process.

This is unacceptable. Within 2 weeks the savings account will have received the third credit on interest and they will again incorrectly withhold taxes on these interests. I am writing this complaint to ask 2 things. First, make Citibank finally process my tax status and eliminate any withholding on my account. And second, make Citibank reimburse me for any taxes withheld so far.

My father is her financial power of attorney and has access to her three bank accounts to handle her financial affairs and cover her living costs as she is no longer able to do so. All three of her accounts were with PNC Bank, two checking accounts and one savings account. She receives her monthly social security check to her savings account monthly. This monthly income is used for her assisted living expenses. PNC bank WITHOUT notice closed her savings account in XX/XX/2020. We had received her XX/XX/2020 statement and there was monthly activity, the most recent being on XX/XX/2020. We have tried to reach out to PNC and get an answer as to why her account was closed. We were unable to get through to a person that could give us a clear answer or help set up a new savings or help us connect her social security to one of her checking accounts so she may receive her monthly direct deposit. This is not the first issue we have had dealing with PNC bank. A few years ago we used their business banking for our family 's small business and due to their extreme lack of care for anything other than deducting monthly fees from our accounts we closed our business accounts and have tried to have minimal contact with them. I have contacted PNC through their XXXX page and again received zero assistance for their mistake regarding the closed savings account. Their XXXX  page is riddled with complaints from their customers and their responses show a severe lack of accountability. Personally I feel terrible for the employees that are forced to be on the front lines handling these customer complaints when it is the institution of PNC bank itself that is the problem. Their policies and practices show they only exist to charge over the top fees and use their customer 's money to invest in the stock market. They show such an extreme lack of regard for their customers and doing the right thing in general I'm shocked anyone would choose to use them for any type of banking needs. I was hesitant to file a complaint since in PNC 's view my grandmother 's account is chump change and probably not worth their time. However, my grandmother desperately needs her social security to meets her monthly expense needs and is unable to defend herself or navigate opening a new account.

569,2019-07-11 00:00:00,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"Chase fraudulent charges I am writing to dispute JP Morgan Chase Banks decision of denying reimbursement of fraudulent charges to my savings account ending in XXXX. 

My husband and I noticed fraudulent charges onto our savings account on XX/XX/XXXX. We immediately called Chase fraud services to report. They took the info down and started a claim. We received a letter with the info of the claim ( see attachment ). There were a total of six fraudulent charges on our account. We did not initially notice the first four, as they were smaller amounts. We had a large sum of money in our savings at this time, and did not notice a small amount missing. 

As soon as we noticed the large amounts, we notified Chase. We, then, received a second letter the following day ( XXXX ). It states that Chase isnt going to reverse the charges on the most recent fraudulent transactions because the first ones are more than 60 days old. 

We then went to our local Chase branch in XXXX, OH on Monday, XXXX XXXX. We spoke with a representative, XXXX. We explained the situation to her and she immediately said, I am only the middle man. She proceeded to call the fraud department while we were in her cubical. After getting off phone with fraud dept. she explained to us this 60 day law as she called it. She says, They can not break the law and that the FDIC made it up and they have no control over it. We explained to her that XXXX  XXXX  is willing to cover all the charges and reimburse us provided that Chase contact them, letting them know it was a fraudulent charge. She told the Fraud dept. this. After hanging up with the fraud dept she said they told her that theyre still unwilling to reimburse the fraud transactions, but they did file a claim with XXXX XXXX. She said we didnt need to do anything at that point but to wait for XXXX XXXX to credit the account. Meanwhile she closed out our Savings account and moved our money to our checking account. 

XXXX proceeded to blame us for the fraudulent charges on our savings account. She told us how we shouldve had our alerts on and that wouldve notified us of the fraudulent charges. I asked XXXX repeatedly about the XXXX XXXX   account being in a name completely different from either of ours. Her response was that anyone can use anyone elses account. We dont know who you let use your account. I believe she meant a XXXX XXXX account. I hope she did not mean savings!! Regardless, if she meant XXXX, NO!!! You can not let someone else use your account. And the account was never verified as being the correct account. ( per XXXX  XXXX  ). I asked her why it didnt raise a red flag to them having someone else debiting out of my savings. She said it didnt seem out of the ordinary since we had our sons college tuition debited ( only two times ever! ) out of our account, when the first two fraud debits were done months before! This doesnt add up to what she is telling us. Chase has taken no responsibility and XXXX put all the blame on us. 

To set the record straight, I had every available alert on to my knowledge. When I told XXXX this, she stated, well there are always new alerts Chase is coming out with. How are we, the consumer, supposed to know this? We were never given any info that there were new alerts on our app. Also what if we did not use an app. Then what? When does Chase have to take responsibility? When are they held accountable for the security of their customers money? 

XXXX also stated that this kind of thing happens a lot. It even happened to her husband. If Chase knows this why did they not inform their customers to be alert and pay attention to their accounts because this scam was going on. Why wasnt Chase doing anything to protect its customers. Per XXXX, Chase was aware of how scammers take out small amounts at first, then waited after the 60 days, then took out large amounts. They knew this!! What accountability do they have knowing this??? They did nothing to protect us as customers. 

I have attached documents that show the un- reimbursed amounts along with the dates. If you need I can provide pics of my bank account transactions. Please let me know if you need further evidence of the fraudulent transactions. 

I spoke with XXXX several times, and received the same answers from each person I spoke with. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I spoke with a representative, XXXX. I explained the situation. XXXX stated that Chase just has to reverse or dispute the charges and they will reimburse our account. XXXX also stated that the bank is able to see the name attached with the transactions. ( if thats the case, why did Chase let these transactions go through without concern? ). XXXX instructed us to contact Chase and cancel our account and he did the same on his end so no more charges could occur from that XXXX account or our Savings account. XXXX stated the name associated with the fraudulent XXXX account is XXXX XXXX. He asked if we knew of this person. I explained that I had no clue of this person. 

I spoke with a XXXX, and XXXX from XXXX XXXXl, to have them say the same things. They said that Chase does have the means to reverse the ACH transaction and to be able to dispute it as a fraudulent charge. XXXX states they have NEVER had a bank that wouldnt reverse the ACH charge. She said theyre capable and should be willing. XXXX states they are willing to reimburse the account but need the banks help. I got the phone number and case number to give to Chase. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, after still not receiving any kind of reimbursement, we went to our local Chase branch again. This time we spoke with XXXX XXXX. She called Chase fraud dept. with the same results. She did print out the letter that chase gave us to send to XXXX XXXX. She again reminded us of the 60day law but said if XXXX is willing to reimburse the account she would try and help. I called XXXX at XXXX on the XXXX and left a message with the claim number ( XXXX ) and phone number XXXX to call XXXX XXXXl directly. 

When I spoke with XXXX at XXXX, she stated that there is not a fax number or email to send a letter to. Also, that the bank needed to dispute the ACH charges and that is the only way to get money back. XXXX said that the bank does know how to do that and there is no reason they shouldnt. 

We would like the following to be the outcome of this complaint : 1. We DEMAND a full refund of all the six fraudulent charges, from Chase Bank. We dont care how they do it. They can contact XXXX as asked or just simply refund our money into our checking account ( as our savings is closed ).

2. The refunded amount needs to be XXXX which is the total amount of all six fraudulent charges. ( $ XXXX has been temporarily refunded- this needs to be permanent. ) 3. We DEMAND to be compensated for our lost work time and suffering. The amount to be compensated for this is {$300.00}. We both lost 1.5 hours of work. This equals about {$200.00}. The other {$100.00} is for the time and effort put into research and fighting this battle.

4. We would like their to be a policy in place to let customers know of their 60 day policy in regards to the fraudulent charges.

5. We would like there to be a policy put into place for Chase and its representatives to red flag fraudulent charges and to have a better safety guard for this.

6. We demand Chase and its representatives change the verbiage they use for the FDIC 60 day policy. They need to not tell customers its a law and they can not break it. When in fact, its an institutional policy of Chase. That is misrepresenting the truth to your own advantage.

7. We demand Chase to prove that two AcH transactions to a college ( even though we have two college accounts attached to us ) justifies it being normal for our savings to have ACH transactions. which led Chase, per XXXX, to overlook those fraudulent transactions. ( dont forget the first two fraudulent transactions were months before! ) Our demands are based on the facts that Chase is negligent on being held accountable for poor monitoring of accounts that have fraudulent charges.

Chase is guilty of putting blame on the customer and taking no responsibility for its lack of actions or protection of its customers.

Chase has lied about this 60 day law that we were quoted over and over. The law states on the FDIC website that consumers MAY not get their money back if over sixty days. Does not say its a law and doesnt say they WILL NOT! 
Chase must not be allowed to use this verbiage! 

We have never had a XXXX account attached to any Chase account. This should have raised a red flag to Chase. 

It is so rare for a XXXX account to be linked to a savings account. I would like Chase to prove how many savings accounts in comparison to other types of accounts ( like checking or credit card ) to prove it is not common at all. Even the reps from XXXX XXXX were shocked this happened to a savings account. 

The most important reason that Chase should give our refund is because XXXX XXXX  is WILLING to reimburse the money!!! There is no reason Chase shouldnt reverse the ACH charges or dispute them. What reason do they have? They arent going to be paying us back, XXXX would be.

570,4/14/2020,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"After filing a previous complaint with CFBP regarding Bridgecrest refusing to help customers during the covid 19 pandemic, I received a call from a management representative on XX/XX/XXXX. The gentleman was professional and offered a 2 payment ( total of only one month, because I make bi-weekly payments ) deferment. I still dont believe this is adequate for most people in the situation the country is in at the moment. I feel 2-3 months is proper. However, that is not my problem. I asked the gentleman if I had to cancel my autopay for the deferment, and he stated that no, I did not, and that all I had to do was e-sign a loan modification form. 
I did so at the time it was sent to me. 
Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from XXXX from Bridgecrest stating that she needed my permission to cancel my autopay, so my payments wouldnt be taken out during the deferment. I told her that the gentleman I spoke to the day before said I did not have to do that, and I didnt understand why i was getting different answers. I told her I would just sign in online and do it myself, so I would be reminded to set it back up. 
After the call, I was busy taking dare of my XXXX XXXX, so I didnt just jump to go cancel it the autopay. I received a call one hour and 45 minutes later. I missed the call but called back. The new agent told me that in order to even approve the deferment, that I had to cancel my autopay. At this point I was very frustrated. I told the gentleman that every time Ive spoken to anyone at the company, and I havent called but maybe 4-5 times in 2.5 years, that everyone I had ever talked to gave me a completely different answer and no one ever answered a question the same way twice. 
I tried to voice my concerns as to how they handle business, and in no way ever disrespected the representative. I even made it a point to tell him several times that my problem wasnt with him, but the company. He proceeded to tell me that if I was going to disrespect his company that he would just end the call. 

This company never ceases to amaze me. They dont want to help customers, they only offer to after someone makes a complaint about them, and then want to do only the bare minimum and still give you the run around to get something that should be so simple, done. Ive asked them to not call me again unless its something important but if they feel the need to explain their incompetence to me on the phone, I give them permission to call me or my wife. 
Something needs to be done about their poor customer service and business practice. It shouldnt take everyone filing complaints on them to offer to help.",None,Bridgecrest Acceptance Corporation,VA,None,None,Consent provided,Web,4/14/2020,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3606212

576,12/22/2019,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Problem with paying off the loan,"XX/XX/XXXX, 3 DAYS BEFORE XXXX Dear CFPB : My Navy Federal Credit Union used motorcycle loan was paid in full on at its full maturation date which was 61 months from XX/XX/XXXX. ( Original amount : {$11000.00} ) After paying off the loan on time, I was hit with a bill due in 30 days for {$1100.00}. This is the first communication I had with the bank about it, not knowing what it was for and INCORRECTLY ASSUMING it was some sort of balance or balloon payment due unbeknownst to me because I was not made aware by any means what this amount represented so here is my inquiry email to NFCU : Subject : Used Motorcycle Loan - XXXX - {$1100.00} Payment Your Message XX/XX/XXXX : Hello, I am confused about why my payment amount is now the full balance. If the full balance is NOT due, am I due for another payment on the XXXX? 
Navy Federal Response XX/XX/XXXX : NFCU Response : Hello, Mrs. XXXX. According to our records, your Used Motorcycle loan has a maturity date of XX/XX/XXXX and the remaining loan balance is due in full at that time. If you are unable to pay your loan in full at this time. We encourage you to contact our Collections Department directly for assistance with a payment arrangement. We can be reached at XXXX, any counselor can assist you and our hours of operation are Monday through Friday from XXXX XXXX  to XXXX XXXX  and weekends from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, Eastern time. We look forward to speaking with you as soon as possible. 

As you can see, the explanation was still unclear to me as to what the {$1100.00} figure represented. I was simply told that this was a remaining loan balance due. I was still confused as to how there would be any monies due, much less {$1100.00} on a XXXX total loan amount. 

I was in between jobs for about over a month and was going through a background check for consideration on a new job while at the same time caring for my husband who was hurt in a head on collision just over a year ago and is unable to work. My credit lines are at their maximum limits and I had been borrowing money from family and close friends to survive while at the same time keeping up with all payments and living very scarcely. My bank accounts ( Personal ckg, business ckg. and several credit accts. ) are also with NFCU, and they chose to transfer my last dollar in any of my accounts ( {$140.00} ) out if my ckg. account to apply to this large mystery amount due. They had done so in the past several times when my payment was overdue. ( Never 30 days late, but would sometimes pay after the due date ) but I assumed that because they serve the military, that they would not do this if they were not legally able to do so, however, I never checked until XX/XX/XXXX when a member service representative said that I signed this right to them in my loan paperwork. I personally never saw it, or do not recall it. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was left then with no money for food or gas or any type of survival and trying to stay composed as I was in the middle of my background check. I was stunned and crying when I called the bank on or around XX/XX/XXXX when I realized I had no money left in my bank account when trying to buy food. I spoke to another member service representative who gave me an emergency gift of {$50.00} and advised me to go to the bank 's "" financial hardship '' website and provided the web address. She said that she would put notes on the account stating not to transfer any more funds for 14 days and that NFCU would replace the {$140.00} once I made contact through the website. This was evening, so I went to the website the following morning, XX/XX/XXXX so I would have a more clear head. In the days to follow, I was contacted by the "" hardship department '' ( aka collections department as I later found out ) via phone and answered one time in the middle of conversation with my new employer just to let her know I couldn't speak at that time and would definitely call back. I called back and received the woman 's voicemail and left a message. We played an unfortunate game of phone tag, what with the holidays ( on her end, I'm not having a holiday this year ) and performing all the tasks related to an extensive on boarding process for this new perspective employer, which happens to be a competing credit union to NFCU. I was hired and began work on XX/XX/XXXX, I've now been there just one week into my probationary period and my first pay will be withheld so I am in desperate need of funds to make it to work on a 45 minute commute back and forth and have none! I can not negative entries on my credit report or my employment will be terminated, fyi. On XX/XX/XXXX, my husband 's retirement check was auto deposited into our bank account, which we allocate to our rent each month. It is small but needed, {$320.00}, and after midnight on XX/XX/XXXX NFCU transferred the {$320.00} to the balance of this unknown fee after stating it wouldn't be transferred and that I would receive the first transferred amount back ( {$140.00} ) once I made contact with their so called hardship department ( aka collections dept. ) They have not put me in jeopardy with my my place of residence AND my job, over this unknown amount. On XX/XX/XXXX I was finally able to reach someone in their collections dept and relay this entire story to them. I pressed them to tell me what the {$1100.00} figure represented and he could not understand what it was. I was placed on long term hold until he returned after speaking with a supervisor and said that this amount represented a {$29.00} fee that was assessed each time I paid after the due date over the life of the loan 22 times over 61 mos., totaling : {$630.00}. The remaining {$500.00} is interest on the {$630.00} for a grand total of {$1100.00}. ( just for fun, I suppose ) and 25 days into the fiasco since it first showed up on my online account will now trigger a 30 day late to my credit report in five ( 5 )  business days if I do not pay it in full or have a payment plan in place and I will eventually lose my new job and be in jeopardy of losing my place of residence and possibly facing homelessness. On XX/XX/XXXX during my last phone call, NFCU stated that they will replace the monies into my checking account that they transferred out, a total of 3 transfers ( forgot to mention another transfer for {$2.00} toward the fee ) but it will take 2-3 business days. Being that the first day is Sunday, this doesn't count, and the third day is XXXX, that won't count either. That's if that even happens because NFCU didn't come through the last time they promised. 

I believe that the assessment of the interest on top of accumulating late fees collected on the back end of a loan is an unfair lending practice, or if not, should be. I am contacting the credit bureaus as well to dispute the whole amount due to non disclosure or at least the interest.

This was on Citi 's end as I had not receive a debit card nor the welcome packet yet.

On XX/XX/2019 - I contacted Citi and they said the charge was due to the accounts not being linked. I assume the accounts being linked is the norm since you can transfer money between them, but apparenty it is not. I was assured by XXXX at XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX : "" I can assure you that you will not be charged moving forward for as long as the account is able to maintain the fee.

- In XX/XX/XXXXI was charged a {$25.00} fee, but I was unable to get the {$25.00} reversed because I already had a fee reversed in XX/XX/XXXX ( which was caused by Citi ). The Citi employee assured me the accounts were linked I would not incur another fee.

601,7/31/2019,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Struggling to pay your loan,Loan balance remaining after the vehicle is repossessed and sold,"Bridgecrest exemplified unfair business practices especially in the area of payments and false repossession. This company is a predator on those who are struggling with their credit scores and even payments. 

This company was fined over XXXX XXXX dollars for harassment and inaccurate and false credit reporting, and then their name was changed from XXXX to Bridgecrest and the unfair false practices continued. They changed their name to hide false practices and lawsuits. 

I was sold a vehicle that cost thousands of dollars in repairs including leaking oil and transmission issues. But inspite of this I kept making my payments. I became ill in XXXX and informed them of my circumstance. As a result of my illness, there is still an on-going recuperating process. They offered me a Modification in which I agreed. I spoke with two Supervisors who were very professional in assisting me with the Modification namely, XXXX XXXX and XXXX. During this time my health began to deteriate. I kept in contact on a regular basis with them letting them know of my condition and financial status. I had a good payment record prior to my illness. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, to my total surprise, my car was repossessed. I did not receive any written notice that this action was going to be taken. I did not receive any written notice nor did I sign for anything stating that I was in danger thereof. This is illegal! Furthermore, I spoke with XXXX in the re-instatement department that gave me information on how to regain possession of the car. After speaking with her, I spoke with Supervisor XXXX XXXX who reinterated the same. Ms. XXXX informed me that I would have to come up with an absorbent amount to regain the vehicle. Again, I explained I never received any written notice nor did I sign for anything stating I was in danger of repossession. Ms. XXXX explained that if I wanted to regain the car, I had until XX/XX/XXXX and after that the car would be sold. She expressed that the car is scheduled to be sold after XX/XX/XXXX. I reached out to her several times prior to this date to inform her as to where I was finanacially in regaining the car. Again I was told I had until XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I phoned Ms. XXXX to let her know that I was not going to be able to get the car back because of finances. But I was told to call back in 2 hours as she had not arrived for work. I went to XXXX XXXX, the repossession company to obtain all of my possessions out of the car. While in route, I received a call and as a result the funds that was required to regain the car was now on-hand and redily available. I arrived at the XXXX  XXXX excited that I could now get the car back. I phoned Ms. XXXX again to let her know that I would be getting the car back, but she still had not arrived. 
It was too my total surprise upon arriving and speaking to the clerk at XXXX, that my car was not there. The clerk informed me that my car was sold two ( 2 ) days prior on XX/XX/XXXX. I refuted that claim stating that I had until XX/XX/XXXX according to Bridgecrest. She reinterated that the car was indeed gone and sold two days prior. All of my personal belongings were violated and thrown in trash bags. I took possession of these bags and left the property. 

Less than 48 hours later, Bridgecrest reported my repossession to all the major credit bureaus with an astronomical amount. The amount was indeed not the correct amount. This is unfair practices and needs to be investigated. Again I never received any documentation that I was in jeopardy of repossession.

602,8/15/2019,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Struggling to pay your loan,Lender trying to repossess or disable the vehicle,"Filed a complaint with the FTC. Thinking about hiring a lawyer. I'm shocked that there isn't a civil lawsuit already against these people ; what a joke! Toyota Financial has been known for their inhumane practices of "" adding further insult to injury '', even when it comes to folks who have been loyal Toyota customers for years! I never missed a payment or a deadline, & I was known for always paying off in full my credit card balance every month, let alone the bare minimum payment. I have phone call recordings & paper trails that are screaming proof of errors on their behalf. Regardless of my fault in the matter, or any procrastination that was made on my end, none of the above is even close to measuring up, having been compared to the gross incompetence that was displayed by MULTIPLE reps. I asked for a hardship from my {$320.00} payment in XX/XX/XXXXof 2019 due to my fiance losing his job, among other unfortunate circumstances that are too private to share. It was granted, withdrawn, then refunded. To explain, a rep made me fess up to & re-live a horrible trauma in order to "" qualify '' me for the hardship. Having me in tears, she agreed to offer me the hardship for the current month, and also told me that I would qualify for the month of XX/XX/XXXXas well if I needed it. What she didn't tell me at the time was that I apparently had an account with them online that I needed to log into and change a setting in order to prevent the payments from coming out anyway ( I didn't find this out until around XX/XX/XXXX. ) That $ was all that I had to my name @ the time. I found out the hard way that the $ was taken out anyway ( on my birthday. ) I wasn't able to celebrate my daughter 's XXXX birthday that weekend due to having to wait for them to reimburse the check. Also, my bank charged overdraft & transaction fees to my account in order to cover the payment. Toyota Financial agreed to pay for those fees, but the beginning of the damage was already done. Same thing happened in XX/XX/XXXXof 2019, but we didn't get the check until XX/XX/XXXX. More damage was done, and more fees from the bank were added. Come XX/XX/2019, they tried YET AGAIN to take MORE money from my account, which was still overdrawn BY THEM due to the previous month, adding to yet even MORE fees that were still owed to me from XX/XX/XXXX& XX/XX/XXXX( They only reimbursed me for about {$30.00} of the almost {$200.00} in fees, even after my bank sent them proof. ) During the 3 months that Toyota Financial either took my money, tried to take my money, & accumulated for me a beautiful pile of fees, they had the nerve to say that they weren't responsible for any bank fees that were charged as a result of another company trying to withdrawal an automatic payment. I'm sorry, but not only did they not cover all of fees that THEY racked up, but let 's remember that had they not taken the money from my account like they agreed not to in the 1st place, I would of been able to make those smaller payments that were due to other companies! I was @ their mercy, despite plenty of proof of wrongdoings on their end! Eventually my bank account was forced to shut down. Before that happened, my mother deposited an emergency {$50.00} into my savings to help us put food on the table since Toyota Financial was holding our check hostage, but my bank decided to eat that up before we could use it to pay for TF 's fees. Unbelievable. Even more damage done. Oh, & CHECK this one out, the CHECK for XX/XX/XXXXwas nevering coming, BECAUSE NO ONE EVEN BOTHERED TO ISSUE IT! Then, the brilliant mind of a "" supervisor '' named XXXX decided to try and refund me for the month of XX/XX/XXXX, which would of been impossible considering the fact that there was no money that was taken for that month to begin with! But hey, at least they piled on those fees that month, right? Come XX/XX/XXXX, like I said, I FINALLY got my check. I was then told that I didn't need to pay until XX/XX/2019. I. Was. Shocked. After all of the XXXX they put me through these last several months, waiting for money that they agreed not to take in the first place during a time when I didn't have 2 nickels to rub together, only for it to finally show up ... & then to be told that it would need to be almost immediately returned back to them, just added further insult to injury. I was granted 3 full months ( they added another month for their continued failures ) for approved hardships. What I got was 3 months full of added on hardships due to their gross negligence! Then, they had the nerve to tell me that I used up my "" 3 month period '', which just so happened to fall within the same time-frame as their mistakes! Apparently during hardship months, it's common practice for TF to hold people financially hostage, ruin a XXXX good credit score ( mine was in the high 700 's - now I'm afraid to even look @ it ), break-up relationships between folks & their credit union, & damage other client & business relationships! If that wasn't enough, things got way worse. Due to not having hardly any income at all to cover bills before the 2nd check came, I was forced to work less hours. It's impossible fill a gas tank when we are counting change, especially when I have to drive all over town ( & sometimes out of town ) for work. Eventually, I got laid off. My car insurance was one of those companies that withdrew their payment from my checking account automatically. Of course, with no $ in my account, XXXX tried to pull the payment 3 times, & it resulted in fees. inevitably, the policy was canceled, because I was waiting on the check from TF. I wasn't going to risk driving without insurance, but why does it seem like the bad things only happen to good people? XXXX never called us back to discuss further terms regarding the "" 3 untouched months of hardship '' that they promised us in the 1st place. We called him back several times because we were still owed fees, & his comment about having to make a payment in XX/XX/XXXXmade me nervous. The 3 months that would of qualified from there on out would of been XX/XX/XXXX( check finally recieved & month was free of tampering after I went online & cancelled payment ), XX/XX/XXXX( bank account was closed but they tried to process payment again anyway ), & XX/XX/XXXX( same action in XX/XX/XXXXhappened in XX/XX/XXXX- hopefully both months didn't tack on more fees ). As soon as I got that check, I knew the battle wasn't over. We were tired of having to call back repeatedly, only to have to explain the whole story to a Level 1 Rep & then to hopefully to a Level 2 Rep, which rarely happened or went anywhere. Level 2 Rep 's weren't calling back anymore. Funny thing is Toyota was blowing my phone up for payments, yet I figured someone would read the XXXX notes and know not to bug me until XX/XX/2019, unless it was about what they still owed me in fees. But no one investigated, & it turned out the joke was on me. Come middle of XX/XX/XXXX, I was ready to make a payment. Since I knew I was legally right, I figured it would be no problem for TF to subtract what they owed me from the payment. Before I could act, I noticed early one morning that my car was missing from my gated community. I found out by calling the police that it was repossessed in the middle of the night. The second I called TF, their automated system recognized my # and hung up on me. We called from a different # that wasn't on record in order to bypass the system, and finally made it to a Level 1 Rep. She  informed us that we couldn't use their service anymore. We demanded to talk to XXXX since he knew our case. She then told us that he wasn't "" available '' for the day & that she would leave a message for him from us. She then proceeded to give us the # that we needed to call in order get my car back. My fiance tried calling the repo man ( we got his # from the police ), who was extremely rude, and refused to give my fiance even the cross-streets of his business, let alone any other pertinent information ( even though he is listed on the account with TF ). When we finally called the # that the rep @ TF gave us, we were connected to a Level 1 Rep who heard the whole script from our mouths. She said the she could grant us an  extension, but in order to get the car back, we had to pay XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, as well as repo fees. When we contested this, & and told her that we had evidence, she transferred us to a "" supervisor '' Level 2 Rep. This lady was very condescending, & a real piece of work. She basically told me that since I had an account with TF, it was my responsibility to know how it worked. Therefore, the non-authorized payments were a direct result of myself @ fault. XXXX! Even the supervisors @ TS admitted after hearing the phone call recordings that it is the agents job to explain, especially when most accounts are set up by the guy who is selling you the car while you sit across from him. He never explained that I could access it, or that it was even there to begin with. Next, she said I should be grateful to get 3 hardships ( she could care less that they made things worse for me due to employee error ). She often interrupted during my testimony, which is a scare tactic to try and throw me off my game so she can remain oblivious to the facts. I told her that I was still going to pursue justice, and reminded my fiance that we had already filed a complaint with the FCC & other legal parties. We have evidence recorded, as do they. Even my credit union saw the scam for what it was and issued paperwork in our defense in order to handle the fees. This lady, like the repo guy, didn't want to talk to my fiance either. She tried to tell me that I needed to pay for XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, including repo fees, in order to get my car back ( & I wouldn't qualify for an extension ). When I mentioned that the lady just 5 minutes before her told me different, she told me she didn't care. I even mentioned that I had a recording of XXXX claiming that I didn't owe until XX/XX/XXXX, that went out the window too. I guess she won't mind that her call, as well as the call before her, were both recorded too. Cover your XXXX people! Otherwise, corporations & their sheep will walk all over you! Now starts a whole new game! I choose to break free from the havoc that they have unleashed when they chose to royally mess with my family 's financial life and future. Had they done the right thing to begin with and had at least tried to amend their wrongs by starting with the bare minimum, they would of acknowledged that XXXXXX/XX/XXXXwere months full of no error on my behalf and would of made sure that those months would have be added on to the end of my contract as a complimentary gesture. Then, they should of finally granted me the 3 months that I was approved for "" error-free '' in the 1st place for the months of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, & XX/XX/XXXX. Those 3 months would then pass freely, totally untouched. As a result of smooth sailing, and after having been able to finally catch my "" financial breath '', I would have issued my 1st payment, come the middle of XX/XX/XXXX.

607,11/19/2019,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"[ NOTE : Some of these dates are estimated since I did not keep the names and dates/times of my contacts with the bank. I never expected to have this much trouble with Citibank. ] On XX/XX/2019, my wife ( XXXX XXXX ) and I ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), began the online process required to open a Citi Accelerate Savings account with Citibank. We wanted to get the account established to hold  funds held elsewhere with a much lower interest rate and to receive our occasional retirement fund distributions. I am not sure why, but the online application portal would not allow us to complete the application online so we called a toll-free number we saw on the screen and were connected with a telephone representative of Citibank. He assisted us in completing the application by phone since the online application was not working for us. After 20+ minutes, we were told that we had completed all we could by phone and that we would receive a packet of information to complete the application process and to fund the account. We received the packet on/about XX/XX/XXXX. I reviewed the packet over the weekend and called the bank the following week ( XXXX ) with a few questions to clarify their instructions for completing the application and funding the account. On XX/XX/XXXX we completed the two separate steps the bank required submitting a W-9 form and signature card ( going to one address ) and the funding check ( {$6000.00} ) and deposit slip to fund the account ( going to a different address ). About a week later, I contacted the bank at the same telephone number as above and asked for a status update on our account application and the documents we had submitted. The customer service representative was not able to confirm that any of what we had sent had been received. However, they informed me that we had not responded to an email from Citibank, one that I had not seen and as a result had not responded to. The email informed us that we had to provide a copy of a credit card or utility bill in order to verify our address. I was facing a deadline to use the new account to transfer my wifes annual Required Minimum Distribution ( RMD ) from her IRA account. That payment was due to be made on XX/XX/XXXX. Because of this deadline, I asked the representative to help me expedite the submission of the additional required documentation. I was hoping for an electronic submission online since I wanted to speed-up the process, hoping for something quicker than a mailed submission. I was transferred to a manager who assisted in setting-up this online document submission option. He sent me a link to a submission portal and I then submitted a scanned copy of a credit card bill. After I clicked the submit button, a screen popped-up which told me that I could expect the submission to be processed in 5 10 business days which was much longer than I had hoped. This meant the online submission was still not going to be done in time. I established a new destination for forthcoming RMD payment. I also decided to wait to see if the process would be completed as I had hoped. The XX/XX/XXXX deadline came and went and I had the RMD funds transferred to another account. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Citibank to ask for an update. I spoke with XXXX ( Team # XXXX ). I wanted to find out the status of our application and to confirm that they had received our funding check sent two weeks earlier. They were unable to confirm that the check had been received so I decided I wanted nothing more to do with Citibank. I requested that they immediately return my check and withdraw our account application. I asked the representative to confirm where the check was in the Citibank system and to call me with that information and to confirm that the application had been withdrawn. I have yet to receive a response from her. On the next day, XX/XX/XXXX, I went online at XXXX XXXX since that is the bank we wrote the {$6000.00} funding check on. I noticed that our check was presented for deposit on that day. On XX/XX/XXXX I saw that the check had been deposited. On XX/XX/2019, I called Citibank again and spoke with XXXX ( Team # XXXX ) and asked for an update. I was told that there were no notes in our accou8nt file from XXXX ( Team # XXXX ) with any reference to the request to close the account and to refund our {$6000.00}. I would like to receive my funds from Citibank immediately, but they have no process for committing to do that. I dont trust that the money will ever be seen again.

614,8/19/2019,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"Recently my family and I discovered we were victims of online banking fraud.  Someone fraudulently linked their XXXX   account to our SunTrust savings account and withdrew $XXXX through 5 separate transactions over the course of 3 Â½ months dating back to XX/XX/XXXX.  While that amount may seem insignificant to some, we have a single source of income with XXXX young kids and depend on that money trusting it is safeguarded by our bank.  Unfortunately, the way SunTrust has handled the situation and the lack of customer service and care they have shown has been very disappointing.  In early XX/XX/XXXX I was transferring money from our savings to checking account and noticed the balance on our savings account appeared lower than it should have been.  We do not regularly check the balance, nor do we review our savings account transactions because we donâ€™t normally withdraw money from that account.  Since I noticed a lower balance, I reviewed several months of activity and identified several suspect XXXX transactions.  Our savings account has never been linked to a XXXX account, and I confirmed these transactions were not associated with my XXXX account.We immediately called the SunTrust fraud department to report this activity and they opened a case to investigate the issue.  I was informed the process would take 10 business days and they would follow-up with a phone call or email.  However, the only communication we received was a letter from SunTrust dated XX/XX/XXXX stating they would provide a credit of $XXXX because they have a policy that disputed transactions must be made within 60 days.  On XX/XX/XXXX we called SunTrust to determine whether this was the final outcome of our case and they explained the $XXXX represented an initial credit but the investigation was still ongoing and would be completed XX/XX/XXXX.  We followed up on XX/XX/XXXX and the individual we spoke to this time informed us the investigation had been closed on XX/XX/XXXX and the $XXXX represented the final reimbursement amount and no further action could be taken.  On XX/XX/XXXX we called the SunTrust fraud department again and requested the phone number for the SunTrust presidentâ€™s office.  We were told that number can be provided to customers but someone from the office ultimately returned our call.  On XX/XX/XXXX they returned our call with the same message that nothing that could be done due to their 60-day policy.SunTrustâ€™s policies and their mismanagement of our case is extremely concerning.  We also feel this should be brought to the attention of all SunTrust consumers.  First, they determined the appropriate course of action was to credit us $XXXX   even though that was the oldest of the 5 transactions.  Second, the individual we spoke to from the SunTrust presidentâ€™s office explained that even though we had not conducted any transactions on our savings account it was our responsibility to ensure there wasnâ€™t any suspicious activity.  This individual went on to say SunTrust doesnâ€™t have the ability to identify suspicious activity unless a transaction involves a bank debit card.  This lack of oversight and inability to identify threats to their customerâ€™s finances is extremely alarming.  It was my understanding that when banking with Suntrust (or any bank) that it was their responsibility to protect our money.  I also believed our money was federally insured so if anything happened to it through no fault of my own it would be reimbursed regardless of the timetable. Even though I believe this is an issue with SunTrust and they should make every effort to resolve this, I did contact XXXX   to see what could be done on their end.  They were unwilling to help because the transactions were more than 180 days ago, and they were not associated with my XXXX account.I am extremely displeased with the way SunTrust has managed our case.  At no point did SunTrust express any concern with the impact this has had on our family and reiterated it wasnâ€™t their responsibility to do anything.

XX/XX/2019 I contacted the Chase wire department. A representative told me, Im ma'am but the bank recall was denied by the other bank. There is nothing we can do. I ask to speak to a manager. After 30 minutes of being on hold, I was transferred to manager XXXX. XXXX said he will escalate the case their investigators because XXXX is requesting a Hold Harmless letter.

XX/XX/2019 XXXX claims she is not giving me back my money because I contacted her bank ( XXXX ). She reports that XXXX closed their accounts. I reported the incident to the FBI. 
I had a missed call at XXXX, ( which is outside normal business hours ). I called back the number, which was the same as the Chase wire department. I called back Chase wire department. The representative said that was nothing he can do to help me connect with the investigator that tried to call me. I requested to be transferred to XXXX. XXXX said he will email them about calling me back within normal business hours. XXXX said he will email XXXX to inform them that a Hold Harmless letter is being processed. XXXX said he would call me back with an update. XXXX did not call back. When I called back at XXXX, I was on hold for 45 minutes and then disconnected.

I handed over everything I had printed out of screenshots from emails, XXXX messages, copy of the lease agreement, text messages and police report number to XXXX XXXX ( Branch Manager Vice President ). XXXX said, he doesnt have any communication with the wire department or their emails. I gave him the wire department phone number and case number. He said he was really busy and will do it when he can. I return two hours later, XXXX said, he called and talked to the Chase wire department and sent an internal tol the wire department. XXXX said there is nothing he can do, that I will have to contact the wire department. 
XX/XX/2019 I contacted Chase wire department I was hung up on by an employee name XXXX in the wire department and refused to transfer me to XXXX. XXXX yelled and argued with me because I did not know the exact amounts in my bank accounts, and account number. He refused to look up my account by my social security number, address and case number. I learned from another representative that XXXX never sent the email to XXXX bank letting them know that Chase was working on this account. When I finally talked to XXXX, he informed me that he has received my documents. For me to go to my local banker for more information. 
XX/XX/2019 I called Chase Wire Department for 3 hours. XXXX kept refusing to talk to me. I was told by a wire representative to go to my local bank they have the answers for me. XXXX said that he doesnt have any information for me, and I had to call the wire department. After four more hours of calling the Chase wire department, I finally talked to XXXX. XXXX said my Hold Harmless letter request was denied. I ask why, he refused to give me a reason. I call XXXX in tears. I was transferred to XXXX wire fraud department and talked to XXXX. XXXX took my information, police report number, and ask if I can provide them with records of emails, text messages and police report. I said, Yes, I can! I told XXXX that I had everything except the police report that it takes weeks or days for XXXX police to email me the report, but I had the badge number, phone, and police report number. XXXX said she will send an email to put the Hold Harmless investigations in motion. XXXX said for me to call the wire department to do another recall request, and for them to forward the information I sent them. I called Chase wire department, it took three hours before I could talk to someone without hanging up on me. I informed the Chase wire representatives about what XXXX from XXXX told me, and the representatives said repeatedly that the Hold Harmless was denied.. The representatives from Chase wire department kept hanging up on me and refused to transfer me to the manager. I finally got into contact with XXXX, who I informed what XXXX told me. XXXX said we will do another recall that day. XXXX said, but they dont want to give you back your money thats why they are asking for a Hold Harmless letter. I explained this is their procedure. They need to justify why they are returning the money. XXXX again told me to talk to XXXX. XXXX told me to call the wire department. XXXX called the wire department. XXXX called back and said it looks like XXXX doesnt want to give you back your money, XXXX told him that they did 3 to 4 wire recalls on this account. I informed everyone the account at XXXX for XXXX XXXX was still open and the funds are still there. 
XX/XX/2019 XXXX called me at XXXX and said he will take my complaints to the executive branch. He said he is trying to help me and doesnt know why the Chase wire department keeps sending me back to him. He said someone should be calling me by Tuesday. I called Chase Wire department at XXXX. I was on hold for 30 minutes. I talked to XXXX from the Chase wire department, I gave him my name and that I wanted an update on my wire recall. He ask me for my account number, I told him I didnt have it. XXXX hung up on me. At XXXX I called the Chase wire department. XXXX said no bank recall was done, in fact only one recall that was done on this account. The Hold Harmless was denied and the case is closed. I requested to get transfer to XXXX and he said another recall will not be done because they will just ask for another Hold Harmless Letter. XXXX said he sent an email to XXXX requesting the money to be returned without a Hold Harmless Letter. I talked to XXXX they informed me that only one bank wire recall was done. When they ask for the Hold Harmless letter, they thought the wire recall was abandoned because Chase did not respond to their request. Again the representatives from the Chase wire department lied to me. 
XX/XX/2019 at 10:30am XXXX from Chase Executive department called me that they received my my complaint from the FTC . I would get a response in 15 days. I requested that the documents I sent to Chase to be forwarded to XXXX. XXXX said she will look into it and let me know if they can send the documents. XXXX did explain that a Hold Harmless letter states XXXX is not at fault for this transaction, that is why a Hold Harmless Letter is difficult for them to do for me. At XXXX I talked to XXXX from Chase Wire Department. She said that there was no response from XXXX regarding XXXX email to them. She said that another wire recall will not be completed because it will cause them to create another case. I called XXXX wire department and talked to XXXX. She said since Im not a XXXX client she cant take any information from me. 
XX/XX/2019 XXXX I talked to XXXX from Chase Wire Department. XXXX said that the Hold Harmless letter was denied. ( Which I did not ask about ). Ses said that the email was sent from Chase to XXXX XX/XX/2019 at XXXX. She said that XXXX replied XX/XX/2019 at XXXX that the request requires a Hold Harmless letter. When I repeated what XXXX said, XXXX began to say she meant regarding the Executive investigation. However, I was very clear about what I was talking about and what email I was referring to in my phone conversation. This is my biggest issue with Chase is the poor communication. I feel that both of the banks are lying to me and do not care because its not their money. At XXXX I got a call from XXXX Executive department that they received my complaint from FTC , the individual said XXXX XXXX is assigned to my case. I will get a response in 15 days. 
My complaint with XXXX is their unwillingness to investigate the fraud. Its extremely unethical to allow someone to use XXXX as a means to commit fraud. 
My complaint is that Chase is not doing to due diligence in helping me. Chase wire department are not willing to do the Hold Harmless letter because its just too much work for them. They are refusing to send the documents to XXXX because their intentions are to punish my family and I for being scammed. I feel that if I wasnt a minority I would have been provided with better customer service and a Hold Harmless letter would have been provided. My family life savings are in these accounts that are intended for my daughters college tuition. By losing this money we are distressed and my daughter is becoming suicidal. My daughter is set back in her education because of this. Every penny we need for her college education. Chase wire department is destroying lives for people of color. Please help me.

Application id # XXXX. I was told that additional verification was needed to determine my residential address. I was asked to submit a utility bill for verification of residential address. I submitted a copy of my electricity bill on XX/XX/2019 via email. When they got the bill they started making excuses that the bill was not right. Now they started questioning the balance on the bill but it was not anymore about showing "" residential proof ''. I was told that because my bill had a balance that my application for a savings was being denied. I was surprised and confused at first. I did not know that because of my balance I could be denied and I was never told that a bill without a balance was needed. I mean who has utility bills pending and there is no balance or pending payment coming up? Is ridiculous. I am convinced that this bank HSBC found an excuse to deny my application without justification for the sole purpose of "" DISCRIMINATION ''. I don't believe this bank and I think they are using racial profiling to discriminate about certain individuals based on race. I will provide a copy of my bill and there is nothing wrong with my utility bill except a balance coming up by the end of XXXX. After talking to XXXX over the phone on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX I was told that my application was being denied because there was a balance on my account and also a late payment fee on my bill. About 10 minutes later I got an email saying that my application was being denied because "" they were not able to verify the address of the applicant ''. Just to cover themselves they sent this email explaining other reason for the denial. This whole process smells fishy to me and I don't trust this bank and I know they are not following proper rules but discriminating against XXXX applicants. Is just not a sufficient reason to deny my application because there was a balance. There is got to be a more serious reason and they don't have one to explain. In conclusion HSBC Direct Savings is a discriminatory branch against XXXX is my conclusion with no basis for denying my application.

Now BMO Harris has put a hold on the funds until XX/XX/XXXX which is 12 days AFTER my Bank disbursed the {$5000.00}. In the meantime the money is idle and not earning interest. This hold of 12 days is excessive and abusive. 
2. The interest is not posting as of the end of the month as it is customary with all Banks. BMO Harris says it will show the interest posted at the end of the monthly cycler. 
3. To talk to a human at BMO Harris takes usually 30 minutes or more on hold. UNACCEPTABLE! 
4. Communications by email go unanswered. 
5. When you ask to talk to a responsible Manager you are not allowed and given a runaround. 

In my opinion, this Bank is a SCAM and should be investigated by Federal Banking Authorities. I have now made a 2nd deposit of {$5000.00} via on-line transfer and they don't even acknowledge that 2nd deposit. I am very concerned that my {$10000.00} will be lost!

632,12/27/2019,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"I had a checking and savings account with Wells Fargo. My Checking and Savings Accounts were fraudulently accessed by an unknown person at various ATM locations, apparently using my debit card information and PIN to deposit checks into my savings account, then transferred the funds to my checking account, then withdrew these funds. These transactions occurred between XX/XX/2019 and XX/XX/2019. Around the same time between XX/XX/2019 and XX/XX/2019, approximately {$4000.00} in credit card charges were applied to my Wells Fargo Visa. 

Sometime around the end of XX/XX/2019, I was checking my bank accounts and noticed money missing. I called called Wells Fargo, who immediately informed me of unusual activity ( large amounts of money being deposited and withdrawn ) and that my funds were depleted. They also noticed large amounts of charges on my credit card. Wells Fargo immediately closed my accounts so no further transactions could occur. They explained to me that as a result, I only had {$100.00} credit in my checking account and owed Wells Fargo {$450.00} on my savings account. 

Wells Fargo advised me that unless the balance owed was paid within 30 days, I would be sent to collections. Therefore, I paid Wells Fargo {$340.00} on XX/XX/2019, to satisfy the remaining balance. I have the receipt. 

{$450.00} Balance on savings - XXXX Credit from checking {$340.00} Over the next week, Wells Fargo sent me several letters along with the fraudulent checks. These copies have been provided to the adjuster, XXXX XXXX, as an insurance claim has been filed. 

I also submitted a claim with Wells Fargos Claims Assistance Center, with the hopes of recovering the funds stolen from my checking and savings accounts ( approximately {$1500.00} in my savings and {$300.00} in my checking ). After review, Wells Fargos Claims Assistance Center sent me a letter on XX/XX/2019 stating Based on the information available to us, and because the transactions were made using your card and Personal Identification Number ( PIN ), we found it was made by you or someone who had your permission. Please consider your claim closed. I have a copy of this letter. 

Upset, I called the Claims Assistance Center and spoke with several people, who would not give me  enough information to explain the reason ( s ) for their denial, so they transferred me to an investigator. Because I had been on the phone for 45 minutes and had to take my friend to the airport, I gave the investigator permission to speak with my dad. He explained that these ATM transactions occurred in Georgia, Indiana, and Illinois using my debit card and PIN. My dad explained that I didnt give my debit card and PIN to anyone ( I still had it in my possession ) and I was working at XXXX XXXX in the XXXX XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Tennessee on the days in question. Therefore, my debit card must have been duplicated. The investigator said that was not possible due to the chip technology in the card. My dad asked him if there was video footage, since most ATMs have cameras. He said they checked, but no video was available. My dad offered to provide him with copies of my time cards to prove I was working in the XXXX/XXXX   area on the dates of these crimes, but he said it wouldnt matter, as these actions could have been committed by someone I knew. I then filed a Police Report on XX/XX/2019 ( Report # XXXX ) with Officer XXXX. 

Finally, my dad also filed an insurance claim for the fraudulent charges on my Visa Credit Card and I am still waiting to hear from Wells Fargo on this matter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,TN,370XX,None,Consent provided,Web,12/27/2019,Closed with monetary relief,No,,3478659

XXXX XXXX told Citi that it was my money. Additionally, Citi froze my funds so I could not get my money out of my account. Citi told me I would get a letter with the details.

My account balance is more than {$25000.00}. 

I am unclear why I have received inferior service from the executive team and the portfolio team. The executive team ( XXXX ) ndicated I would be considered for the most competitive interest rate and she would contact Mr XXXX about this. However, when I spoke with Mr. XXXX on XXXX, there was no competitive rate offered whatsoever. He was out of the office on XX/XX/XXXX so I was not able to lock in a rate. 

I initially had an appointment with him on XX/XX/XXXX to discuss the interest rate. He did not contact me at the scheduled time. I tried to reach back out to him but no one with his team was able to or willing to connect me with him. This led me to contact the executive team. 

I do not understand why the bank is unable to provide me a competitive interest based on my loyalty and account balance. 

I do not feel valued as a customer. We live in a competitive market and your competitors are offering superior customer service and promotions/incentives to customers. 

The executive team has not been helpful or taken any ownership in the concerns raised. This has been time consuming and does not reflect well for Wells Fargo.

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- BACKGROUND ( SUMMARIZED ) Citi practically stole my savings account for 63 days by freezing it without my consent. I had no access to it and was provided no useful information or was offered a real way to resolve the issue. In over at least 15 phone calls, correspondence, and complaints, I hit dead ends for all of them. 

As a result, I suffered a monetary loss in the amount of {$600.00}, the opportunity to earn interest in the amount of {$300.00} ( by putting it in a higher interest account ), and I have lost HOURS of time in making multiple calls and writing correspondence that Citi does not seem to take seriously. In addition, my account was terminated without cause. I am looking to be compensated for my monetary and time loss stated above. 

I am suspecting illegal asset freeze ( see other similar complaints in XXXX  and CFPB by other customers ). For the unexplained account closure, I am suspecting discrimination. 

For more detailed background, I have provided comprehensive explanations and complaints here : CFPB complaint # XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ; XXXX  complaint # XXXX, XXXX. 

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- MY MESSAGE TO CITI I have maintained a professional attitude in my past correspondence, but this is just ridiculous. Your latest response is downright disingenuous. I am appalled at how it clearly shows that you have chosen to ignore my MULTIPLE EXTENSIVE explanations and responses that I took time writing through multiple channels ( XXXX, CFPB, and CERU ). 

By continuing to provide generic and impersonal responses, I feel that instead of trying to resolve the issue of your victimized customer, you are just trying to tire me out hoping to make the problem go away. 

Let me address the content of your latest response on each point : "" First and foremost, please be advised that under no circumstances does Citibank condone any behavior or practice which discriminates against anyone on the basis of any physical or personal criteria, such as race, XXXX, national origin, gender, religion or XXXX orientation. While we understand that you feel you were not provided an adequate level of service, upon our review, we found no evidence to support your claim of unlawful discrimination on the part of our policy.

They all pretty much said, "" Sorry we can't help you. We can not even reach the 'back office ' that processes your case ''. FYI, I have called the number multiple times even before you provided it to me. 

Please refer to my previous explanations here. You have access to all of these. Next time check them up before responding : - CFPB complaint # XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX.

I talked to XXXX from the wire department, I gave him my name and that I wanted an update on my wire recall. He ask me for my account number, I told him I didnt have it. XXXX hung up on me. At XXXX I called the wire department. XXXX said no bank recall was done, in fact only one was done. The Hold Harmless was denied and the case is closed. I requested to get transfer to XXXX and he said another recall will not be done because they will just ask for another Hold Harmless Letter. XXXX sent an email to XXXX requesting the money to be returned without a Hold Harmless Letter. Again the Wire department lied to me. 
My complaint is that Chase is not doing to due diligence in helping me. Chase wire department are not willing to do the Hold Harmless letter because its just too much work for them. They are refusing to send the documents to XXXX because their intentions is to punish my family and I for being scammed. I am requesting that the FTC investigated the consumer practices of Chase bank.

When I opened this saving account, it was stated that "" Access your money, with up to 4 withdrawals per statement cycle fee free. '' There is no definition of the length of the statement cycle on that webpage when I signed up. ( See attached a screenshot of the webpage ) In this case, I believe that most of the ordinary customer like myself would assume the statement cycle would be monthly by common sense, since I have never encountered a bank issuing statement that is not on a monthly basis. 

When I reached out to BBVA 's customer service regarding the fees that were charged. They stated that their four free withdrawals are on a per quarter basis, which was quite surprising to know. I then tried to do some research to find out their fee schedule and couldn't find it from their website. However, based on the information I got from the internet, I am not the only one that believes their four free withdrawals are on a monthly basis. See this website for your reference : XXXX XXXX XXXX Their free-withdrawal limit is unclear and misleading. 

I then asked them to confirm that whether the four free withdrawals are on a per quarter basis or a monthly basis. They provided me with a fee schedule that is not easy to find : https : //www.bbvausa.comXXXX I asked them to refund the fees because if I am aware of this unique withdrawal requirement, I would either not opening this account at all or be careful to keep the withdrawals under limits.

According to a customer service representative spoken to on the phone, the account was closed due to suspicious activity. No further details or explanations could be given on the case because not enough information was available to the representative. The company failed to inform me of their actions and completely disregarded me as a customer. Also, Popular XXXX failed to contact me to report the suspicious activity. The company then charged a whopping 25 dollar closing fee. This company is clearly using shady business practices to open accounts for new customers, promising them high-interest rates, to then close them days later for their benefit, and charge heinous fees in the process. These actions are completely unfair and should really be taken into account when trying to provide good customer service. I did not commence the account closing and should not have to pay or be charged a fee for actions on behalf of the company. It is completely ludicrous and shows a level of high disregard for customers hard-earned money. I am now 25 dollars short for something I had nothing to do with, and the company is 25 dollars richer.

674,2019-06-12 00:00:00,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Closing an account,Can't close your account,"This is the craziest thing I have ever heard in banking. I work for XXXX. I have an HSBC savings. I had a checking there that I closed, and have a credit card that I am closing. I thought, last year, I lost a cashiers check of {$10000.00}. It was my money that I took out from HSBC, put in their savings account, and withdrew it to deposit elsewhere. I really think this company makes it difficult to leave. They issued a new one and had me stay there signing all kinds of notarized affidavits to issue a new check, of my money, and told me it was an exception to do this. The new check and the old had no expiration dates. Last week, I found one of the checks and tried to deposit it and it was returned by my other bank, XXXX. XXXX told me it may be returned because the date was XX/XX/2018. But, they said since it had no expiration date, they would try to see if the deposit would go through. If not they said to talk to HSBC. It didnt. That was fine. The assessed me {$12.00} for the return check fee today and said before, I could waive the charge. I went to HSBC this week. They refused to allow me to close my account and said I owed them {$10000.00} because I was issued two checks and they may have been cashed. I went off. One was supposed to be cancelled, stop payment, before it was deposited. The new one that I received, I couldnt recall if or where I deposited it. I am experiencing health problems and my short-term memory is fair at best. They could not even tell me which bank either was cashed at. Their research department is investigating and it takes them 7 to 10 days to do that. And, get this, they cant call the research department. I was there and asked, and they said they couldnt. I am so done with HSBC. As an XXXX  employee, I will file a complaint on any financial institution thatI can not get service from. I did years ago, against XXXX XXXX, because I couldnt close the account and get {$70000.00} from them. My reason was the same. I could not get though to talk to anyone via phone, and then when I would, I would be transferred, and transferred again, and then it would discount. Same situation except HSBC has a brick and mortar office near my condo. XXXX is online. So I have wasted my time, being sick, going and spending hours there just to do normal transactions. The VP there blamed me, for depositing two checks. Really, they should be able to trace transactions to ensure a cancelled check isnt cashed. And, she then told me they dont cancel or stop payments on checks. I XXXX near fell out of the chair. Why the XXXX would they keep me in there last year signing all of this paperwork, issue a new check, and not tell me the old one wasnt really cancelled, because their checks expire 90 days after non-deposit. Well, that would have been good to know then. So, when people lose, misplace, or have checks stolen and possibly cashed when they thought the HSBC branch cancelled it, HSBC expects to be paid for the deposited amount of the check that was supposed to be cancelled. But, oh wait. They dont cancel or stop payment on checks. Truth is stranger than fiction. The examiners should look into their IT systems. And this policy. It is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard from a bank. Thank you for looking into to this. Whether they trace and find the other check or not, they would never get their money back, especially if it was found by someone else and cashed. That alone is stupid. Have them fix this and save others this trouble. 

Also, I left a {$1000.00} in the savings maybe {$1500.00} because I thought it was a good bank and didnt want to close the account. They are holding my money while they research the two cashiers checks, and will not return it if they find that both checks were cashed. Well, get this, XXXX returned the one I deposited. SO THIS SHOULD BE A NONISSUE. There is no way both checks could be cashed. It is a wash. But their VP didnt understand this until almost one hour later of me arguing with her. Nor did the other person. A third person, employee, a personal banker, was there who completely understood and agreed with what actually happened. And understood that. I had to look up the rejected check in my XXXX account, have them take a phone shot of it because their inadequate IT system could not see the transaction. They had to have the research department look into it. They had no record of it in the branch. What the XXXX kind of institution is this where the branch can see their own rejected checks and cant call another division to find out what the XXXX happened? Their security systems are so good they cant even talk to each other. Too bad the rest isnt so. Thanks for looking into this and please check their IT systems. Or have an IT examiner go in and do it. They say because they are an international bank they are regulated more strictly and have more protocols. XXXX. So is XXXX and I dont have that problem with them. I can get my money anytime and they can reach back while Im standing there and get an answer in five minutes. Just like the rest of XXXX products, the services are below par too.

I funded the savings account with {$15000.00} that was required with the intent to place {$25.00} to the checking to meet the requirements. A couple weeks after applying to open the account I never heard from Citi Bank. The savings account was funded but I was unable to transfer money from my savings to checking.

I called the number as the email directed as it stated "" Your submission will be reviewed within 3-10 business days. If you have not received a response after 10 business days, please call XXXX option 2 for assistance. "". I have called since then 5-7 times and each times I am able to speak to a manager who tell me there is a block but they are unsure why it is still there. Sometimes they tell me it is because they still need to verify me but can see that my forms are submitted and look good. They then tell me that it is the 'back office ' who must review them and they can not undue the hold. It has been 2 months of this 'back office ' never getting back to any of the emails the supervisors send on my behalf. I reach a dead end with supervisor and anyone on the phone and they will not provide an email or phone number to this 'back office '. They won't tell me why it my identity is not being verified and I have never had any issues in the past. Three weeks ago I ask to close the account since I just want my money back but was told it is this 'same back office ' who processes this request and have never heard any response back about this request.

The last time this occurred on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told it 'might ' be an automatic trigger from the system since I tried to transfer such a large amount and their fraud system kicked in. They say to try again. It gets rejected again. They don't know why. So right now I feel as though my money is trapped in Citi Bank. I can not fully open the account without signficant holds, I can't close the account because the same people who undue the holds won't respond to fully open my account and they won't let me transfer my money out of the account.

When I got the XXXX, 2019 statement,, I saw that the interest rate was very low ( near zero ), I went to the Citibank XXXX XXXX branch on XX/XX/XXXX and saw that there was a Cit Savings account promotion to pay 2.00 % interest for 3 months ( up to {$2500.00} ) with a {$25000.00} deposit. After that, it would pay 0.57 %. 

The manager at the branch said I could get the higher interest rate if a new account was opened. So my old savings account was closed and a new account was opened on XX/XX/XXXX. These are the relevant account numbers : Checking account- # XXXX Old Savings account- # XXXX Ultimate Savings Account ( USA ) New Savings account- XXXX XXXX Citi Savings The original balance on the new account after the transfer was {$260000.00}. The current balance on XX/XX/XXXX is {$200000.00}. The account balance has been over {$200000.00} since it was opened, well in excess of the required {$25000.00} minimum.balance. 

I received higher interest for XXXX of about 1.30 % which was a little less than I expected but at least it was higher than before. But then at the end of XXXX, I was shocked to see that the account only paid an interest rate of 0.12 %. I went to the branch and asked why the interest rate dropped so much, and they said they thought I was entitled to the 2.00 % interest rate from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. They filed an internal inquiry with Citi headquarters to get the higher 2.0 % interest rate paid. 

But at the end of XXXX, I was shocked again to see again that the interest rate for XXXX was again only 0.12 %. I went to the Citibank XXXX XXXX branch this afternoon fo find out what happened. The branch manager told me their internal request was rejected. I couldn't understand why it was rejected, but he said it was because the new funds from XXXX were originally deposited in my checking account more than 5 business days before the new savings account was opened. Even if this is true, this was never explained to me when the new account was opened, and I could have invested with another bank offering a higher interest rate. Overall, I think their 2 % promotional offer was highly deceptive and they should have told me before hand if I was not eligible for the 2 % promotional rate.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,None,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2019-04-12 00:00:00,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3458363

As a result, we're respectfully denying your claim. '' Transfer was made by a thief, and not available for our personal use ; because we were not aware that the unauthorized transfer was allowed by the bank until after-the-fact, when we received a bank alert on XX/XX/2019 that our account had been accessed by an unknown device. By that time, it was too late, our money had already been stolen, and was unavailable for our personal use. Since the money was stolen in person at the XXXX XXXX, VA branch by someone impersonating my wife, the money was not used to pay an obligation owed by us. 

We were told by a bank employee at our branch that to do this, the thief had to present two forms of identification ; which was most likely a driver 's license, and my wife 's bank debit card. The bank 's own records of her checking account show that on XX/XX/XXXX, her legitimate debit card was used to make a purchase of {$25.00} at the local XXXX 's store in XXXX XXXX, Fl, and could not have been used on the same date in Virginia. 

The bank 's records also show that for the savings account, her debit card was used to withdraw {$400.00} from the Bank of America ATM # XXXX in XXXX XXXX Fl, and could not have been used on the same date in Virginia. I ask the bank to examine the camera footage from this XXXX XXXX ATM, and compare it with the camera footage from the XXXX XXXX branch to clearly see that not only were these not the same people involved, but also that it is physically impossible to be at two distant locations at the same time. My wife 's employer has provided us with records which prove that she was at work in XXXX Florida on both XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX and could not have been in Virginia to personally withdraw funds from the Virginia branch. 

Based on the incontrovertible evidence which I have provided, I ask that the bank reverse it's determination derived from its ' flawed superficial investigation. My elderly in-laws life savings were taken as part of this fraud, and they can not sustain such a devastating loss.

683,1/18/2020,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"I own a joint savings account with my teenage sister with the intended reason of giving the funds to her once she went to college. However, we relocated from California to  XXXX, in which, to our dismay, we discovered there are no Citibanks. Since moving, I have tried contacting Citibank multiple times in order to have my account closed and the funds sent to my new address. Because there are no Citibanks in California, I have had to do all of this via mail, based on the information I have obtained from them over the phone. 
This issue with Citibank has been ocurring since approximately XX/XX/2019. We had not used the account for some time, therefore, the first step they had me do was reactivate the account, which I did. After that, I followed up with them and the account had in fact been reactivated. Then, they had me send a letter to Citibank in order to close my account, which I did. I was sent a letter back saying they required of me the account number, which I did not have on hand. However, based on my phone call prior to send that original letter, the employee over the phone told me it would suffice if I sent them the social security numbers of the owners of the account, which I did. I was perplexed when I received the letter from Citibank stating that they could not close the account. 
I called Citibank again, this time the first employee told me I had to have the letter notarized, something they had not told me before. I was so profoundly upset, I then asked to speak to the supervisor, who then told me that this information was not true and I did not need to ahve the letter notarized. Luckily, during this time period I was able to locate a statement I had amongst my papers. I was so grateful at this moment. I went ahead and wrote another letter including the account number, and also had the letter notarized. I received another letter saying that the account had been closed! I never did receive a check. It is important to note that I did have my address changed with them as well, so I was expecting to receive a check in the mail. To this day, I have not received the {$490.00}. It may not seem like much, but they are funds we have worked for to put aside for my XXXX-year-old sister and I expect them to be returned to us, as it is our money. I have made phone calls and sent letters but I have not been helped as expected.

Being that I am the XXXX XXXX for this company I am asked to be on multiple accounts, like at least XXXX business accounts. The XXXX  that I am over are all democratically ran, therefore I am XXXX XXXX on all these accounts. So that way when a XXXX "" votes '' in new check signers they have to go through me to be added, this is to prevent any issues as far as fraud, theft, etc. because I am able to monitor them online. I am able to view ALL of the accounts I am on and when I add signers to an account they are only able to view the balance, make withdraws, order new checks, etc. and that has to be in a branch and not online for the most part. Well, recently I had a XXXX  called XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX ( same as the bank account name ) had some issues with people using drugs and alcohol in the XXXX. These XXXX  are for individuals recovering from substance use disorder. So, we have a lot of turn over. So, when the XXXX  services group found out about these allegations towards this XXXX   they went over there to check it out. There was a resident drinking while XXXX  there. So he was asked to leave. They started looking into their financials ( I even made a guest account so they were able to view the account online more thoroughly ), they saw on the account where there has been a transfer to a savings account for the last year. So, they called me and asked me to see how much was in the savings account and I told them I don't believe they have one, but I still logged in to check it out. I did not see a savings, if there is one, I wasn't on it. So, they started going through the filing cabinet at this property and found documents where it says I am on the account and I swore I wasn't. So, I told them to make copies and bring them to me at the next monthly meeting. This happened around the XXXX of XXXX of XXXX. The meeting we had was on the XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX on Friday. So, I looked through the papers that night at the meeting and found that somehow a savings was made by the two  XXXX  ( that btw, have relapsed and are gone now ), and the banker XXXX XXXX opened this account WITHOUT me being there, and also handed these two guys paperwork with MY ENTIRE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER ON IT, and MY ADDRESS, and MY DRIVERS LICENSE NUMBER. So, this documentation has been in their hands since XX/XX/XXXX, when the account was opened. Also, I was able to get a print out of the statements for the savings today and there have been several withdraws out of this account at the bank because these residents were stealing it, well, embezzling it. I go to the bank today to address this matter, and XXXX no longer works there and also, basically, I was told that this happens and they will push this complaint up the chain and that, that was all they could do. I AM VERY UPSET THAT MY PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION WAS JUST HANDED OVER LIKE I'M A NOBODY. I have talked with my lawyer and I am filing this complaint due to their advice and counsel. I have documentation supporting ALL of this, but I will not upload it because it has very personal information on it but I will be more than happy to bring it and let you all make copies of it.

713,2019-08-08 00:00:00,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Opening an account,Unable to open an account,"HSBC Bait and Switch Operations This spring I received in the mail a solicitation from HSBC Bank to open an account online called an Advance Checking account. I called the information number on the solicitation to ask some questions I had. At that time I was also encouraged to open a Direct Savings account online that paid 2.3 % interest using the bulk of the money I initially put into Advance Checking. 

I went online in XX/XX/XXXX using the code number for a bonus that came with the mail solicitation. After providing all the requested information on the designated HSBC website, it rejected the application. An auto-generated email to me said my identity couldn't be verified. I had provided my valid New York State Driver 's License information and my own phone number, address, SSN, etc.

I called their phone numbers for help, and after much time on the phone I was advised to try again. They could not tell me what exactly the problem was. I was also advised over the phone that after opening the account, I could open the online Direct Savings account paying 2.3 % interest and transfer most of the money to that account.

After another failed attempt to open the account online, with the same result, I called back and was advised to go to a branch to open the account. This I did. I went to the branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX ) and presented the coupon that came in the mail, which the bank officer took. At the branch, I was advised by the bank officer that they had a 5-month 2.3 % CD I could shift most of the money into once I funded the Advance Checking account. This was at the end of XX/XX/XXXX. 

A few days later I sent {$10000.00} to my new HSBC account ( # XXXX ) by ACH transfer from another bank. I then went back online to open the 2.3 % online savings account. After completing the application, it was refused. Once again, the emailed reason was could not verify identity- even though I now had an account at HSBC . 

I called their "" help '' number, was given another number to call, and after taking my information and supposedly doing something to fix the issue, this person said to try again in 24 hours. I did that, and once again was refused- "" unable to verify identity. '' I emailed the branch officer who opened the Advance Checking account and asked if she could do a transfer into the CD we'd discussed. She did not reply. Instead another officer responded, I presume the branch manager, and said it had to be new funds, which of course was NOT what the first officer had said. Then I asked if they could open the 2.3 % savings account, and was told No, that's online only. 

As the bank had my verified identity in its possession after I had opened the Advance Checking account, it was invalid to refuse to allow me to open the Direct Savings account on grounds of non-verification of identity. I am entitled to interest from the date I attempted to open the account in XX/XX/XXXX. 

As of now, this is the response from HSBC : I raised two issues in my complaint against HSBC Bank. One issue was completely ignored by HSBC bank in its response, and remains unaddressed, and the other issue was responded to with false information and misdirection. 

There was no explanation or even a reference to why HSBC blocked me from opening the online Direct Savings account with the automated claim "" could not verify identity '' even AFTER I ALREADY HAD AN ACCOUNT with the bank! Their "" customer service '' dept. just said try again in 24 hours, after supposedly making a fix. Same thing happened. This account was offered as a teaser over the phone to induce me to open the checking account. To avoid fees I have to lock up {$10000.00} for 6 months. 

As to the matter of the CD offered at the branch, I did NOT request it on XX/XX/XXXX, but on XX/XX/XXXX, as my dated email proves. And this business of missing an imaginary deadline of XX/XX/XXXX by a day for the money I had on deposit to be considered "" new '' is spurious. No officer at the branch said anything about a deadline. And the only mention of "" new '' money came later from the branch manager, who emailed that "" new '' money was required for a CD. Again,  nothing about missing an imaginary "" deadline.

The supervisor I spoke with told me that he could request the check be sent by XXXX-XXXX but that the request might not be granted, and that it could take 7-10 business days to receive the check. 
XX/XX/XXXX I called Citibank again ( 6th time, and 5th time since my original call ) to check on the status of the check and request a tracking number. Again I asked to have my call escalated to a supervisor, and this time I spoke with XXXX. XXXX said that the check was reissued on XX/XX/XXXX and generated on XX/XX/XXXX. He said that there was no tracking number. He said he would follow up to see where were at, confirm that the check was mailed to my address, and would call me back on Saturday ( today, XX/XX/XXXX ).

721,2020-07-02 00:00:00,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Closing an account,Can't close your account,"BBVA USA is the most dishonest and unethical bank I have ever dealt with. 

In XX/XX/XXXX I opened a Money Market account with BBVA USA bank ( XXXX, AL ). I chose BBVA specifically because they advertised on-line an interest rate of 2.4 % which was competitive with other banks. Within a short time after opening and funding the account, I noticed in the on-line banking app that the interest rate on my account was only 1.39 %, 42 % less than what was advertised. I called to complain about this "" bait and switch '' to BBVA. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX of BBVA sent me a message documenting that I had complained about the interest rate. At that time, his response was only that BBVA wasn't showing any deposits listed in the account. He said he couldn't actually see what interest rate was being paid on my funds. From XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX I deposited {$200000.00} in the account, thinking that XXXX would correct the interest rate to the advertised rate. However, when I went online I found that the interest rate was still at 1.39 %. I tried to withdraw funds online from the account, and found that BBVA limits withdrawals to {$5000.00} per day and {$10000.00} per month, and they also charge a {$3.00} per transaction fee for each withdrawal transaction, which I had never seen in a bank. I tried to transfer {$5000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX but BBVA failed to execute the transfer. I called to complain and inquire as to how to transfer the refunds. They offered to sell me a set of checks which I could use to close the account, but they do not provide any free checks. BBVA obviously gets funds by bait and switch and makes it as hard as possible for customers to withdraw funds.

When I advised BBVA by phone that I wanted to close the account due to the "" bait and switch '', high fees and poor customer service, I was told that I would need to send a written request to close the account, with instructions of where to transfer the funds, and a copy of my driver 's license. I provided that information in a letter on XX/XX/XXXX. That letter contained instructions to transfer the funds by EFT to an account at another bank, which had already been linked electronically to my BBVA account. Over three weeks later, BBVA had not responded to my written instructions, although they did post a message confirming they received the letter. When I called to follow up, they said I needed to have the letter notarized ( not mentioned in their original request ), which I immediately did and re-sent it on XX/XX/XXXX. It is now almost two weeks later and I still have no response. So I called again on XX/XX/XXXX. They said they had not received the letter. I demanded, consistent with their fiduciary duty, that BBVA transfer the funds by EFT to the external bank that was already linked to my account. I told them it was my funds, my intentions were clear, they had the EFT link already established and had used it to transfer funds INTO the account. They refused to remit my funds and told me that I needed to send yet another letter, notarized and with a copy of my driver 's license ( I have already sent, and they have acknowledged receipt of such letters, notarized and with copy of drivers ' license ). I believe the only reason they are requesting this third letter is to further delay the return of my funds, allowing them to unjustly benefit from their very low interest rate.

The above practices are all unfair, unethical and illegal. BBVA advertised one rate and paid a rate nearly 40 % below the advertised rate. BBVA violated its legal and fiduciary duties by ignoring repeated requests to EFT transfer my funds and illegally holding over {$200000.00} of my funds when my instructions were crystal clear and made three times orally, and two times in writing.

Consumers should be warned to stay far away from this bank, with their deceptive, unethical and illegal practices. I hope the bank regulators provide appropriate sanctions and punishment for BBVA 's behavior.

724,2020-02-02 00:00:00,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"My issue with Bank of America started XX/XX/XXXX. I have had a surplus of fraudulent activity occur with all of my accounts at Bank of America including personal checking accounts, personal saving accounts, custodial accounts, investment account. The perpetrators have done electronic transfers, electronic checks and bill pay. They have set up accounts in names, both individual and companies. They have made payments to companies directly from my accounts. I have taken precautionary measures that have been recommended by Bank of America. These measures have included closing and opening accounts, changing online login and passcodes, adding security questions, adding safepass, getting a new cell phone and number, banking off of XXXX   mobile device and getting a new mobile device, filing a police report and filing a report with the sheriff 's department. I have done all of the above more than 6 of 7 times. I have gone into Banking centers. I have been on calls for anywhere from 2 to 4 hours getting transferred from one department to the next with the explanation of that is not within the scope of their department ( although I had waited 30 minutes to even get someone on the phone for each department ). I have had most of my fraudulent withdrawals returned but what I am writing about is a transaction that occurred from my daughter 's custodial account in XXXX XXXX this transaction was one of many that occurred at the same time from different accounts. the amount of the withdrawal was {$2500.00}. Initially the amount was returned. I was notified that no additional action was needed on my part. The past few months I had to freeze ALL of my accounts. That account was already frozen after the above fraudulent activity occurred mid-XXXX. In having recurrent fraud I went back to scan all of my accounts, even the ones that were frozen and noticed by daughter 's balance was the {$2500.00} less than before. once I started investing I found and was then told that the funds had been taken back because I did not submit the required paperwork that has to be filled out within 60 days of the complaint. as mentioned above I had already been told no additional action was required at that time because they investigated and found the refund was appropriate. After finding out this new bit of information I asked next steps and I was told that it was resubmitted and I would have to wait until they heard back from the merchant, who is XXXX. I tried vehemently to explain that this was an error and to look at all the red flags on my account. They continued to regurgitate the policy so I waited. well I just received their response stating that after their research they state that the merchants received proof of my enrollment or documentation. This is completely false which is why I am admitting a formal complaint. Before receiving this letter I even wrote to corporate and did not receive one phone call, email or letter from corporate. I required a signature whenever the letter was received and someone did sign for it..again I have proof. I believe this may be internal. I have changed my online access so many times and have had instances where I would actually be talking to an agent and someone would be trying to log into my account real time. A few agents were baffled and was able to see that these logins were done from the same XXXX snf computer but could not see an IP address. I just want my daughter 's money back that we are saving for her college tuition and I plan on moving all of my accounts. This has been the only bank I have banked with and am so disappointed. I was hoping we could get these things resolved. I am a platinum member and was used to the bank so continued to try things their way to try to stop this activity. I have so many notes, documentation, names, dates that it is too much to scan and attach. but I can definitely provide all that when needed. I gave the XXXX County Sheriff 's department a sequence of events and they are investigating. A case number can be provided. I have a very descriptive email to the sherriff outlining the sequence of events including account numbers, names they used to open accounts, emails used, phone numbers attached and merchants/corporations they transferred money to. Dates with details listed included XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and it continued into XX/XX/XXXX. I just received an email 2 days ago about another attempt from an account that is frozen. although these accounts have been changed to new accounts. old accounts have been left open and frozen with negative balances so that activities my be tracked. all this being said to explain that it does not take a wise person to figure out that if all this has happened, the money taken from my daughter 's account is also fraudulent. it is not my fault that an agent told me that no further action was needed and bank of America 's excuse is that now they have to make a decision based off of the merchant. I have that letter attached. I can provide a plethora of documentation to support my complaint. I am a physician and the last thing I have time for is tracking my funds and being in constant communication with bank of America about my hard earned money that they just gave away to a criminal. they obviously do not have a secure system. it is definitely a inefficient system and too compartmentalized.

I had the same issue with XXXX XXXX just less than 6 months ago. 

History : I have a Way2Save Savings account with Wells Fargo. To keep my life simple and structured, I plan a year ahead of time and set up Automatic Bank Transfers to increase my balance in the Savings A/c. I have set up Recurring Deposit {$100.00} ( once every 2 weeks ) from another financial institution into the Way2Save Savings account. 

Issue : On XX/XX/2019, I got an email that the scheduled transfer ( of deposit to Way2Save ) was unsuccessful. I find out the reason that the Way2Save account has been disabled for the due to NO deposit or withdrawal from the account by visiting a bank ( physical brick and mortar ) in the last 24 months. The message that accompanied the warning was the one that was far intimidating It read that if the account had been inactive for long period of such inactivity, then the state ( govt. ) can claim the balance in my account under the term of escheat. 

This is really atrocious. In my mind, State Govt. or any Govt. authority can not come in between a private individual and a financial institution to claim any money, even if it stays inactive. It is not a lottery money that the State can claim. It is hard earned money of an individual ( and possibly to the individuals immediate family needs, if the account holder is deceased ). 

I find that this kind of term applies to an individual checking/savings account with a balance on the account with period of inactivity.. but when it comes to an account such as mortgage account with the same bank, I am sure there will be no such disabling done for not making a mortgage payment for a period of time. ( Of course, the home with the outstanding balance will be taken over by the bank ). 

I opened a case with Wells Fargo bank to register my complaint, but as per the existing rules, I am sure they have nothing much to do. But this law is something that is not sitting well in my mind. How can a regular / periodic deposit of {$100.00} once every 2 week, not be considered as a transaction? Why would I have to walk into a physical bank to make a dummy deposit or withdrawal to keep my account active? Even if the crazy rule/law needs me to keep my checking/savings account active, I have never gone into a bank ever to make my mortgage payment Why dont they have law to make the mortgage account inactive?

XX/XX/2019 i validated linked account and submitted initial deposit it happened to be limited to XXXX. Then i tried to make another transfer and learned that any deposit or withdrawal is limited XXXX per month. So obviously this limits liquidity and freezes funds. Given this situation I've double checked with BMO Harris if they limit transfers initiated by another institution and received the answer that no limit on deposit but online withdrawals are subject to the same XXXX per month limit. I've requested to return the initial deposit and close the account as they didn't disclose critical information on the account operation terms and this doesn't fit my needs of liquid funds with competitive interest rate. They didn't complete request and just advised that account closed within first 90 days is subject to {$50.00} fee.

I was informed by XXXX that there had been a security incident on XX/XX/2020 and that a small number of clients accounts had been compromised and that some of my personally identifiable information could have been compromised and therefore my account had been locked. 

I then asked why I wasn't notified via email/phone/mail that my account had been compromised/hacked as I should've been notified immediately so I would be able to update my passwords to all accounts and monitor more closely for any potential fraudulent activities. To my understanding, it is a requirement of Regulation P that there is a certain window of time where I must be notified by the company if a privacy event has occurred and I wasn't notified at all. I had to log into my account and then call in as my account was blocked to learn that my account had been hacked and my non-public personally identifiable information had been compromised. 

I then requested that XXXX, the Fraud Department employee, follow up with his supervisor regarding this privacy matter as he was not available at the time and that his supervisor would need to follow up with me to understand why I wasn't notified and if my NPI had been compromised. I was told that I would be contacted within 24-48 business hours from today, XX/XX/2020. 

It is highly illegal and a regulatory violation to not notify customers of a privacy breach.

I got my first statement at the end of the month, and saw that my actual rate was 2.00 % APY. Around the same time, I received an email notice that the rate would be dropping to 1.85 % APY on XX/XX/XXXX, around two weeks after I opened my account. 

I contact HSBC to request that I be given the advertised rate, and they denied my request but acknowledged my complaint. The terms on the website state that "" APYs are variable and subject to change after opening. '' However, given the cost, both in time, and potential fees, it seems unethical and unfair for the bank to change the rates so soon after the account is opened, and by such a large amount ( a 10 % reduction in the rate!! ). 

Had I known that the rate would change so suddenly, I never would have gone through the time and effort of opening the account. 

Further, there is a charge for closing the account within 180 days of opening it : "" Account Closing {$25.00} If your account is closed within 180 days of opening. '' Additionally, as of the writing of this report, the rate displayed on the HSBC Direct website is 2.00 %, but according to the email that I received, the actual rate that a new customer can expect is 1.85 %, which is apparently false advertising.

The application included an authorization for a {$1000.00} ACH debit to my checking account at another bank to open the Citibank savings account. After I submitted the application, I had some questions about the account, so I tried to call Citibank to ask those questions. After going through many automated phone options, I couldnt reach a human. I became quite concerned about putting my money in a bank where I couldn't readily reach a human and wanted to cancel the application ( most of our savings is currently at XXXX XXXX, paying a lower interest rate than Citibank, but at XXXX  a human answers right away ). After finally reaching someone, I was referred to a couple other 800-numbers. I finally reached XXXX at XXXX. I told him to cancel the application. He assured me the application would be cancelled and my checking account would NOT be drafted for the {$1000.00} opening deposit. 
My checking account was drafted for {$1000.00} on XX/XX/2019. 
On XX/XX/2019 after being transferred many times at Citibank, supervisor XXXX told me the account was indeed opened. She assured me she was closing the account and a check for {$1000.00} would be mailed to me within 5 7 business days. She did give me the option of using yet-to-be-sent debit cards to empty the account. I told her I did not want to do that because of ATM fees, etc., and that Citibank would probably come after me and damage my credit rating over unpaid account fees, etc. I told her to close the account and send the {$1000.00} check. 
Today is XX/XX/2019, 10 business days after XX/XX/2019. I have not received the {$1000.00} check promised by supervisor XXXX.

He transferred me to New Account Servicing Group representative Semper, Team # XXXX. Semper put me on hold for 3 minutes and said she put in another request to close the account, and that a check should be mailed in 7 10 business days.

Citi bank opened a claim for investigation and I was issued provisional credit on 3 out of 5 disputed charges. The charges occurred between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX.

However, I received suspicious failed login attempts which have been verified to my XXXX account ( three times ) documented and shortly thereafter emails from Huntington stating ( SCHEDULED ) - Transfer Details Item # : XXXX Amount : {$250000.00}, From : Huntington Relationship Money Market xxxxxxxxxxx To : XXXX XXXX XXXX, Savings xxxxxxxxxxxx, Service : Three Business Day - OutBound, we received your request on XX/XX/2019. You should expect to see the funds in the destination account within 3 business days. The timing can vary, however, depending on the institution.

This is regarding your transaction request referenced below : Transfer Details, Item # : XXXX, Amount : {$250000.00} From : Huntington Relationship Money Market xxxxxxxxxxx, To : XXXX XXXX XXXX, Savings xxxxxxxxxxxx, we were unable to complete your transaction ; therefore, the funds have been returned to your Huntington Relationship Money Market xxxxxxxxxxx account. Please expect to see the funds in the account within the next 3 business days.Email ID : XXXX Huntington National Bank was personally called and I spoke with XXXX - HUNTINGTON EMPLOYEE ON XX/XX/2019 WHO IN REMARKS TO OUR CONVERSATION REFERENCE ID NUMBER TO NOTATIONAL POINTS ON ACCOUNT PER XXXX : XXXX XX/XX/2019 RECORDED CONVERSATION. FEDERAL RESERVE INVALID ACCOUNT HOLDER. There way to re-activate the suspension other than per XXXX voluntarily going into a Huntington Branch with a XXXX statement in hand to show that the account belongs to me, more so over, XXXX stated that I could not make any Bank-to-Bank transfers from any other account I have linked from the MMA account, period and there was nothing I could do about this. Huntington National Bank has violated my consumer rights and banking agreements set forth in the account by restricting myself to be able to move or transfer funds and essentially attempting to own said funds by freezing them and not paying me interest. 

XXXX stated that the Federal Reserve sent a message to Huntington National Bank that states only Invalid Account Holder. There is no other information he could or was willing to provide or evidence. I informed XXXX there is absolutely no reason why there would be any discrepancy because any prior transactions were approved between these banks before without issue too include the confirmation of adding the bank account for bank-to-bank eligiblity for verification. The account was not listed prior to the transfer as suspended or anything as such. 

In this instance, Huntington wrongfully suspended my account and the transfer is improperly being held by Huntington in which I believe in criminal error and a way to retain a scheme to hold the funds without paying the 2.27 % rate on the account. Because they have done this and are holding the funds then I will be due interest from the time it has been idled PLUS INCURRED DAMAGES OF ONE MORE MONTH OF INTEREST AUTOMATICALLY added into my account at the the full amount of funds held in the MMA prior to the bank-to-bank transfer on XX/XX/2019. The damages are result of not having access to my funds. The Annual Percentage Yield Earned of 2.27 % on the account is earned for that period requesting additional month as well as a courtesy for this error. 

Also, Huntington National Bank must provide evidence for validation displaying that there actually states INVALID ACCOUNT HOLDER from the US Federal Reserve and all laws under this regulation they have abided to in this matter which allows Huntington Bank to hold into said funds in a continuous pending status In Process in which I have uploaded Huntington Terms of Transfer Statuses Processing - The status Processing will show once the transfer has been released for processing, whereas per the supposed Federal Reserve of INVALID ACCOUNT HOLDER another term would be applied, in another words the transfer is still processing. 

In this instance it appears that Huntington National Bank has cuddled the funds for their own financial gain unless they can demonstrate fully otherwise. It was confirmed with XXXX XXXX XXXX that there should not be any discrepancies to any extent that would impede this transfer. A Huntington employee may have acted fraudulently. 

Due to the discrepancies, it can be assumed that Huntington National Bank has potentially commingled funds and as a result of all prior issues resolved into misled advertisements and account guarantees which have been validated then all matters to report to all federal, state and local regulatory authorities. 

If Huntington National Fails to provide actual transcript copy of message ( s ) from  the Federal Reserve then it can be conferred they acted in criminal behavior recklessly under Racketeering.",None,"HUNTINGTON NATIONAL BANK, THE",PA,None,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,9/27/2019,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3389132

I immediately felt where she wanted to fake the conversation I told her I got the money order from a check cashing place and had a few of them. She asked me did I want go withdrawal the 2 or 300 dollars that was available immediately for use while my check processed for clearance. I declined because I did not need it at the moment. We ended our conversation with her telling me that my bank card would arrive in the mail between 3 or 5 business days. exactly one week later after opening my account I went to withdrawal the 2 or 300 dollars that I was told was available to me for a bill. While in the drive thru of the bank I had communicated with a teller and given her my bank slip.

A few days later I called XXXX and she said she did put in that code and I also emailed US bank support from my account panel got a reply saying that bonus code was applied. So I wanted to meet XXXX and the first time I was told that she was not available and so I left and then 2-3drd time I met XXXX ( banker, I think ) and she told me the same thing - that I need to talk to XXXX or may be I can call her but she was "" not avaialble '' and she says this both times, she ( XXXX ) is looking across from her table to the check/customer counter bedhind where XXXX is standing - so she in the branch but not available.

I said ok, I get the point and I left. I want to clarify that - may be I was wrong to go back to stand in line to talk to her when XXXX had already said that she was not available - I understand that but I would not have gone to stand in line but when I said that to him and looked at his face, from his expression, I thought XXXX was ok with that - that is the way I felt or else I would have left.

The last step was to get the ATM pin established and the ATM was outside so went and we did that and as everything was done and it was 3-4 mins till XXXX XXXX - closing time but as I was sitting there for so long I had to go to the restroom badly and as he was going in, I wanted to go in to the bathroom but he said sorry but we are closed now and wouldn't let me go in - now you might think the bank closed, all the staff left and the front door got locked so he said I can't go in - no, that was not the case, he himself went in and there were other staff and the doors were not locked yet. I ended up walking up to the fast food place a block away to use their restroom. 

In closing, there is no justification for the same "" not available '' excuse everytime - if "" the assitant manager '' XXXX were a responsible trained staff she would have definitely made an effort to talk to XXXX after I left to find out more about this and would have made an effort to to call me or email me by now ( she already knows that I have been there several times and heard from behind the counter ). If XXXX were a responsible person, he would have taken my number and would have told me that he would make sure XXXX would call me, instead of saying "" I didn't send the email, ask her '' response. So, I waited until the XXXX and I decided to open this complaint here as I have no interest in going back to that branch to see any of these people again - if I have to go to a branch, depending upon the outcome of this, there are a couple of other US Bank branches nearby and unless it is the same corporate culture everywhere. At this point it is not just the issue about the bonus but the service too so I searched online to see if others have had similar issues, and while researching I found out that some other users have an issue with this specific bonus too where some of them said they receive it after chasing for months and while bankers had no clue or not being helpful and the rest were given some other reasons and did not receive it and I am sure unlike us who spent so much time following it up I am sure many just did not have the time or gave up - and then like some other customers in the comments here, I have had the same analysis service charge fees that started showing upon my statement all of a sudden on an account I have had for several years and I only found about it a few months later ( images of comments attached ).

My employer plan was through UMB bank ( https : //onlinebanking.umb.com/ ). This was not my choice, but rather the bank my company worked with to facilitate this XXXX benefit.

I was not notified of any changes or fees within my XXXX. I continued to use the check card associated with my UMB XXXX account. 

After 16 months, I noticed a {$2.00} monthly charge on my account.

I opened the account on XX/XX/XXXX, set up an external transfer account ( via verification of trial deposits ) and attempted to move the {$10000.00} to the account on XX/XX/XXXX. However, even though my external account was verified, there was no way to transfer the funds to my savings account ; the funds could only be transferred to a checking account. 

I called customer service and they said that I was unable to transfer funds directly to a savings account because of the limit on withdrawals ( this made no sense to me since I was transferring money into the account not transferring it out ). Regardless, the agent I spoke to ( XXXX XXXX, direct line : XXXX, NMLS XXXX ), said that I could transfer the funds to my checking account first then transfer them to my savings account and it would still constitute new money for the purpose of the promotional bonus. I did this in two transactions of {$5000.00} each into the checking account ( which were completed on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, respectively ), since there was a {$5000.00} limit in transferring the money into my checking account at that time. I then transferred the full {$10000.00} into my checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. 

120 days after the account was opened on XX/XX/XXXX, was XX/XX/XXXX, which was a Saturday. I called the general customer service line for the bank on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX Central Standard Time ( "" CST '' ) and was told that promotional bonus distributions are made on Tuesdays. When the bonus was not deposited on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I called back on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX CST and was told that I would not receive the bonus because the funds came into the savings account from the checking account. 

At this point, I called XXXX XXXX directly on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX CST, left a message, and actually spoke to XXXX at XXXX XXXX CST that morning. XXXX told me that I should receive the bonus as the funds did constitute new money. He escalated the case to his manager that day ( record number XXXX ). 

I have called several times over the past two weeks and there has been no further development. I called and left messages for XXXX on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX   CST, Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX CST, and Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX   CST. After it was clear that XXXX was no longer responding, I spoke to XXXX XXXX ( NMLS XXXX ) on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX CST and she told me that the escalation team had approved the promotional bonus and would be deposited by today, Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

When I did not receive the bonus, I called back in to check on the status at XXXX XXXX CST today, Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. I was transferred to customer service, and spoke with an agent ( "" XXXX XXXX '' ) who told me that the reason my case was escalated was because the {$10000.00} was not deposited on the day my account was opened ( this is not a requirement in the terms of the promotion and the online account application offers two funding options : by check and by transferring funds from a bank account ). XXXX told me that the escalation had not been approved and there have been no further developments despite my multiple calls and attempts to move this along over the past two weeks. XXXX and I reviewed the terms of the promotion and she agreed that I had met the requirements and did not understand why the case had to be escalated. I left a message for XXXX, since what XXXX told me directly contradicts what she told me last week, but have not heard back yet and frankly, do not expect to hear back given how I have been treated so far. 

I also spoke to XXXX XXXX supervisor ( "" XXXX '' who would not give any identifying information other than that she was the only XXXX in the two contact centers the bank has in Illinois ).

His name is XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX And he resided with my brother XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX. But the similarities stop there. My father is a kind and loving father. What I can not believe is that I have been fighting this so long with no acknowledgement from the offending parties. My father died at XXXX   years of age. He survived the XXXX XXXX  XXXX and was on the XXXX XXXX. 

He passed with a will and I am a co-executor along with my brother XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The First National Bank of Pennsylvania located in XXXX, PA operates as its own jurisdiction and not part of Pennsylvania. 

They took liberties with my fathers accounts and as a result I received no money from any of my fathers accounts. 

My brother is best friends with the 2 appointed Judges in  XXXX and with the Attorney my brother hired to probated the estate, a less than honorable XXXX XXXX. 

I had a meeting with them regarding the estate on XX/XX/2018. I had an Attorney in front of me and my bother beside me. Attorney XXXX asked me to sign papers to request information from the bank on account numbers. 

I was a XXXX XXXX XXXX  at the time and we signed in order to move things forward so, I did not notice a trust issue. Well, I realized in a slow burn over time that he had me sign the accounts over to my brother, In Trust For. 

My complaint with this bank is that : 1. Prior to my fathers passing, I was told to go to FNB to give my social security number to, my niece gave me a specific teller. I did so and the teller said, was this about verifying your number on accounts. I said yes and gave my social security number. I was very uncomfortable giving my number that way but, I did. She took my number went into the computer and did not give me any further information or instruction.

2. Bank paperwork was provided to the Attorney on XX/XX/2018 and I was told to sign and not date. That is the nagging statement that alerted me to the impropriety. I did so, in trust. Then, he did not read the will and I was done. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received the resultant paperwork from Attorney XXXX XXXX office. 

3. One of the accounts they made in trust for my brother was In fact a XXXX  XXXX  account with XXXX in it that had gone into bank dormancy. They had a problem and had to give that to me. When I went to my XXXX  XXXX branch of FNB I heard the same phrase sign and do not date. There should be an electronic transfer verifications for these after-the-fact idiosyncrasies. 

4. I have a very good FNB bank in my home town of XXXX XXXX, PA. These tellers were so good and conformed to bank policy and I could tell funny things were happening on the other end in XXXX, PA. 

5. There is a bank account that XXXX XXXX did not present to me on XX/XX/2018 at XXXX. That is the precise account and of course ; all the other accounts that my fathers will states I am to receive half of all. 

6. As a co-executor of my fathers last will and testament, I never knew the sum of what my father, a sacrificed, laid up for his generation. I will stay the course to know. 

7. Please, check for withdrawals say XXXX withdrawals came out of accounts. This would be money that went to the safe. I am asking a lot, I know. But, what price freedom. I ask for help is freedoms name. 

8. FNB XXXX gave Attorney XXXX XXXX Typed Bank information that was not validated until after Attorney XXXX got my signature on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I will send account numbers that I have in a follow-up communication. The safe was not verified and these accounts were not distributed properly. My brother received 97.6 % of what I can see.

Approximately 10-12 years ago, as a young adult, I accessed my own USAA banking account and said savings account was associated with it. I was able to see balances and transfer money in and out of it under my own authority. I have continued to use this account without issue since that time. 

Today, I noticed that this account ( with {$810.00} ) was no longer appearing. USAA did not warn me this would happen. USAA did not notify after it had happened as to why. I had to call to find out what had happened to my money. 

They informed me that it was an error on their part - that I should have never been able to view the account and that said error had been corrected ( 10 years later ).  What about the money in it? The custodian would be responsible for making me whole. And by the by, they were oh so sorry it took ten years to notice this and that that we didn't warn you before or notify you after that we had fixed our mistake that very much affects you. 

Despite my ability to see and use the account be a mistake, apparently none of the transactions I initiated through it are fraudulent or due to be reversed. This seems like a load of corporate CYA that I would love to have satisfactorily explained to me. 

Further, I was relying on money in this savings account to top off my checking account to cover an auto transaction that has posted but is pending. Obviously I may no longer be able to clear this transaction through my checking account because I - without warning - can't access the money in my savings account. The representative implied that the best solution would be to have the custodian transfer the money back to me - which may or may not happen in time. He would not commit to USAA eating any fees associated with a possible overdraft. 

I have been led to believe that this was a systemic error - mine was not the only account impacted. I am fortunate in that the custodian is still living and I maintain a good relationship with him.

However, on XXXX, I received only one check from Citibank in the amount of {$10000.00}.

I opened a Platinum Money Market account and deposited {$10000.00} within 30 days of opening. 
I transferred the money temporarily to my checking account to be able to move it into the money market account. I could not transfer it directly into the account because my other bank requires micro deposits to verify the account. So I had to put it in the checking account for a few days and then I could open the Money market account. It was in there a short time and it seems clear to me what my intent was. 
My checking account shows I transferred {$8000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX to the money market, and the remaining {$2000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX.

834,4/14/2020,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"I opened up a savings/checking account with CitiBank after receiving a flier for one of their promotions. Open and maintain a balance of {$15000.00} for a few months then you will receive {$400.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened this account at their XXXX XXXX branch ( Illinois ). I deposited the {$15000.00}. I was told to put some money in checking and came back on XXXXto deposit {$100.00} into checking account. It was reiterated that whatever I do, do not allow the balance to fall below {$15000.00} or I would not be eligible for the promotion. I regularly bank with XXXX, so there would be no transactions on this account until I was eligible for my promotion. Shortly after the establishment of this account, ACH electronic debit transactions occurred to a XXXX XXXX credit card. Dates & amounts : XX/XX/XXXX - {$4000.00} ; XXXX- {$4100.00} ; and XXXX {$2000.00}. A total of {$10000.00} of fraudulent, unauthorized charges from my savings account, leaving me with a balance of {$4800.00}. 
No red flags or security alerts sent to a brand new customer of a promotion account who is supposed to keep their balance of {$15000.00}, but now they are over {$10000.00} short only a few weeks after opening their account? No red flags as to why I would be paying a credit card that does not belong to me or match the name on my account? That is the first time Citi has failed me. Forward to XXXX of XXXX, all of a sudden I realize- wait! I never received a monthly statement from CitiBank for my promotion account..maybe the the statements are quarterly or its different because this is a promotion account? On XX/XX/XXXX, I go into the bank and sit down with the gentleman ( XXXX XXXX ) who opened my account. He seemed taken back that I was sitting at his desk. I said, "" Hi, I am here to check on my account, because I should be close to receiving my promotion, and actually I never received a statement from Citi nor did I receive the debit card you sent. '' He told me he reordered the debit card and didn't know why I never received it and tried to send me on my way. I said, "" No, I actually need to see a copy of my statement because I never received one. '' He reluctantly printed it off and again tried to send me on my way ... until my heart sank when I saw the balance read $ XXXX.I immediately started shaking and crying, and he told me "" well that has to be your credit card. '' I said, this is absolutely not my credit card- you know I put this money here for the promotion and was not going to touch it. I said what do I do, and he told me when I get home to call this number and dispute the charges. I said, no I would like to do that here. He went over to the manager at the other desk and she seemed annoyed with him and told him he knows what to do- she never approached me to offer assistance. I made the dispute while at the bank and before leaving, he tried to sell m e on their credit card ( while I was shaking and in tears ). I left for home to tell my husband what had happened. My husband was furious and couldn't believe this happened. He insisted we go back to the bank to get clarification of this process from the manager. 

We sat at the managers ( XXXX XXXX ) desk and she told us that 1 ) a debit card was never ordered for me - ( so why did the guy tell me he reordered it? ) 2 ) when we asked her why I never received any alerts or statements..she told me that I was receiving online statements - I told her I never signed up for online statements, nor did I ever receive email notifications that an online statement was now available. ***After investigating on my own- I later find out from multiple customer support agents at Citi, that I was NEVER signed up for paperless statements, and that I was strictly supposed to be receiving mailed  statements. I've even confirmed that they have my proper address, email and phone number ( all information was correct ). I NEVER received a statement from them. Until I complained to customer service and their dispute department for over a month and a half ... what do you know- my first statement finally arrived on XX/XX/XXXX. There is no explanation on their behalf. But what this immediately tells me, and others, is that there is internal fraud happening here. There was a reason those charges weren't flagged and that Citi didn't provide any security measures/contact me to verify charges. There was a reason I didn't receive a statement in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX or XXXX. 

This is what Citi Bank has "" done '' for me at this point. On XX/XX/XXXX when I filed the dispute, I was told I would receive provisional credit XX/XX/XXXX and that they would have to complete investigation within 35 days. XXXX, they send me a letter stating that they started the investigation ( This is the only letter or means of communication on behalf of Citi to me, their customer about this horrific experience I am dealing with ). XX/XX/XXXX comes and we go to the bank- there is no provisional credit- The manager, XXXX, makes a call and gets no answers. However, she promised that this is a process ( understandable ) but that as long as the credit card does not belong to us, that we would get our money back. My husband at that time asked if we should call the police, and she insisted that it wasn't necessary, that they couldn't do anything and that we would get our money back. Our nerves were at ease. Time continues to go by and we don't hear anything. On XXXX XXXX, I went to the bank to withdrawal {$4500.00} as tensions surrounding the pandemic were beginning to build and my husbands business ( XXXX industry ) was starting to get hit. I saw XXXX again and she reassured me I will get my money back. I have made countless calls to customer service- all with the same answer "" you should be getting a letter on 5-7 days '' or they are still working on this. Unless I call them, there is no contact. How do I even know they are working on this? Throughout the month of XXXX, I have called, left messages for XXXX and left countless emails - no returned calls or emails. I have no point of contact on this scary issue. An issue that is keeping me up at night, making me sick to my stomach. In the meantime, I had filled out a random customer survey I received after one of my many calls to customer support. I reported my bad experiences. I received a call XX/XX/XXXX from the survey dept., to find out more. The lady seemed genuinely concerned and said she will try to expedite my case. She even told me that, "" yes, they know it is fraud, and that the card belongs to a "" XXXX XXXX ''. '' This is new information to me. On XX/XX/XXXX, the woman calls me back ( unheard of in this company ) to tell me that she's sorry but they told her they were not able to receive a response from XXXX XXXX  and that they won't be returning my funds since the charges were over 60 days ago. I immediately start sobbing. As XXXX the bank manager told us that {$10000.00} is nothing and that they work with big XXXX dollar accounts ... It might seem minuscule to Citi, but it is an extreme amount for my young family. I am XXXX, my husband is XXXX and we have XXXX XXXX XXXX. Due to the pandemic, we currently have no income and have been deeply impacted financially. Our {$10000.00} is imperative to our family 's well-being. Citi has not expressed any care nor have they provided any communication or level of customer support. So now all of a sudden they say they can't return my money? The survey lady escalates to the executive response unit on XX/XX/XXXX. It is XX/XX/XXXX and I have yet to hear from anyone. I never received a letter that the case was concluded. 

I took my first step, and made a police report with XXXX XXXX PD. I am working with an investigator who is trying to help me. He told me I am a victim of fraud on behalf of Citi Bank- how are they going to make me whole? I call XX/XX/XXXX for an update ... this is when I find out that no one is working on this case. The supervisor offers to open an appeal to the case considering the new information of the police report/involvment and she said this can change the outcome of my case ... .Interesting that the bank manager told us not to call the cops and that they would not be able to help us. So a new investigation has begun, and she has also requested provisional funds considering the situation. She promised that I would get a call back From executive level today on XX/XX/XXXX. It is almost XXXX cst and I have yet to receive a call. I feel like no one is listening to me and I am trying to get tossed to the side. I shouldn't have to wait another 45 days for an investigation with XXXX XXXX, when my issue at this point is with Citi Bank. Citi Bank failed me. They did not send me statements. If I had received a statement, I would have noticed the transactions right away and would have taken action. If I was alerted of suspicious charges and asked to authorize, this would have never happened. Why did I not receive statements? On their statements it says you have 60 days from when we send you a statement to dispute charges ... well I received my first statement form them on XX/XX/XXXX! As a victim of fraud with Citi Bank, there are too many inconsistencies. I am either a victim of internal fraud ( taking advantage of promotional accounts where customers are not supposed to touch funds until they are eligible for promotion- how many other promotional accounts are being targeted? ... this account was attacked shortly after being established- how did my information get out there when I never used it..or I am a victim to Great error by CitiBank that prevented me from receiving statements, or a victim of a breach of undisclosed security where others may have compromised accounts  as well ( just 4 days ago someone reviewed that they had $ XXXX in fraud charges in XXXX and their case has still not been resolved ). There is a coverup within Citi as to why I did not receive statements or a security alert and they are trying to brush me off- they think I am a promotion account and that they will lose my "" insignificant business '' so they don't care about me. They don't care that their failed systems or internal fraud has severely financially impacted my young family. I am desperate for help. My family needs that hard earned money to pay our bills and put food on the table. I am an honest and good person. I can not believe this is happening in a time like this. Please help me.

The reasons I keep writing these complaints are : ( 1 ) I have not received a satisfactory answer and resolution from Citi, and ( 2 ) I strongly believe that this is an unfair and deceptive practice/policy of Citi that others might be victims of ( I have read similar complaints in XXXX  and CFPB ). 

Please try to put yourself in my shoes and tell me if this happens to you, it does not cause frustration and anger because you know it's a policy that victimizes the customer. 

Please read my previous complaints for details, but in a nutshell my family savings was locked on XX/XX/2020 under the excuse of "" being reviewed for fraud '' and "" being reviewed for closure ''. No one in the Fraud Department or Executive Response Unit ( ERU ) was able to confirm why because it is being reviewed by the "" back office '' of which no one even at Citi is able to contact. They told me to wait 30-60 days for an explanation, then another 30-60 days for the account to be closed. So under this ridiculous policy, a customer can be locked out of their own money for a total of 120 days. 

It was only after multiple complaints to CFPB and XXXX  they finally released the funds. That is 63 days after many frustrating calls, emails, and complaints. Hours have been lost. Money have been lost ( I had to take a loan with transaction fee because I could not access my money ). Time have been lost. 

And the explanation Citi provided on why they close my account? Tell me if this is a satisfactory explanation : "" Citibank maintains the right to close an account "" ... at any time with or wihtout cause. '' We may try to notify you in advance should this be necessary, but we are not  obliged to do so. '' So it's a non-explanation explanation. So they threw their customer on the curbside because of what exactly? So Citi is saying to me : "" We don't want you as a customer for reasons that we will not share with you, but we have no issue keeping your money during the long process, because we can make more money out of it for ourselves!

842,2020-02-01 00:00:00,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"I opened two savings accounts between XXXX and XXXX, To fund the first account, i transferred funds from my XXXX savings and I also had a partial salary deposited every week. The second account was funded with a wire transfer for {$300000.00} from XXXX XXXX. Around XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to transfer XXXX. the transfer was held and i was told for a review which will last between 24-48 hours. once the time elapsed, I called customer service to find out the account was blocked for fraud and my online access revoked. I inquired about the steps to take to resolve the issue and i was told I had to wait for a letter in the mail that will arrive between 30-60 days which was unacceptable to me as i had urgent needs for my money. I called every day between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The letter eventually arrived on the XXXX of XXXX and what the letter said was for me to call the number that i had been calling since the XXXX and that my accounts were blocked. So, after countless phone calls, two supervisors advised that i needed to go to a local branch to get my funds sooner. I live in MA where Citibank has no branches. The nearest branch is in Connecticut, 180 miles from where i live. So because i needed the funds, i agreed to drive to Connecticut to take care of the situation. by the way they blocked my account because of fraud but yet i initiated every single conversations i had with the bank. No one has called me to ask questions about the accounts, the funds, paperwork, nothing. So, before driving 180 miles to CT, I had a supervisor from the fraud department call the branch to ensure that i will not have any issues closing my accounts. The supervisor spoke to XXXX and i spoke to him as well to be assured that i could close the accounts and take my money. So I rented a car and drove the 180 miles and when I got there, The rep, XXXX XXXX, called the same fraud department that advised me to go to a branch, to have them remove the block and they refused. Citibank is holding my money under the guise of "" fraud '' but on their advise, i physically drove 180 miles to a branch and they would not close my accounts or give me my money. 
Now, on Monday XX/XX/XXXX, I called again and the representative told me she could not talk to me because i was unable to verify my account numbers. Mind you i had called between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and me not being able to verify the account numbers was never an issue. They would normally ask other questions. Now no representatives or supervisors would talk to me about my accounts, my money until i verify account numbers I don't have and cant obtain because they blocked my access to online banking. yet again they recommended that i go to a branch to get the account numbers which is the same branch i drove 180 miles to get to and nothing was resolved. As of XXXX XXXX, I still do not have access to my {$32000.00} : Rent is due, Tuition is due, bills are due and I have no idea why my funds are being held. the last time i was able to speak to a rep, i was told to wait for a check but i was physically at a branch where they could have just cut me a cashier 's check for my money. this situation has caused me a lot of stress and aggravation.

The flier advertised that if kept {$15000.00} in a new savings account for three months, the bank would give you a {$200.00} bonus.

I called the  bank again on multiple occasions, and they told me that I had not meant a requirement that the {$15000.00} be used to open the savings account. Because I had initially opened the account without the funds and then proceeded to initiate a transfer from another bank account afterwards, they couldn't give the money.

857,2/19/2020,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"On XX/XX/XXXX of 2019, shortly before XXXX XXXX, I missed a call as I was on my way to the gym. I listened to the voicemail and returned the call immediately as it was the fraud department from my bank, Navy Federal Credit Union, regarding some suspicious activity. The first thing I noticed was that I had a very difficult time trying to get a hold of someone through the automated system, which had not be the usual case in the past. Once I did get someone on the line, I stated I had received a voicemail regarding some suspicious activity. She began looking up my information and I logged into my account via my app and we went over the transactions that had taken place that were not my doing, only of these had been flagged. The transactions all had taken place in Georgia and Tennessee. She asked if there was any chance that it was me, and I said no, and that I was in XXXX, CA. I also told her I still had my ATM card with me. While she was on the phone I went to check and see if my credit card had been affected as well when I noticed a large amount missing from my savings account. I selected my savings account and noticed that someone had also withdrawn {$9000.00} in cash. I informed the lady on the phone, and she immediately looked into it. She stated someone walked into a branch in Georgia, requested a new Debit card and pin, and then continued to withdraw {$9000.00} in cash from the teller. She said it then appeared as they took then took that same card to make all the suspicious transactions that had been flagged on my checking account. She informed me that they would have to open up two separate claims due to one set of transactions being via Debit card, and the other being performed in person at a branch. She said they would have to wait until the transactions were no longer pending and had cleared. She said they would follow up with me. I did not hear back from them all weekend, so I contacted them the following Monday, XX/XX/2019. I spoke to someone and asked for an update. I spoke to them the next day as well and they said that I would most likely be receiving a temporary credit to my account for the transactions that had been completed via the debit card effecting my checking account, but would not be able to be temporarily credited for the {$9000.00} cash withdrawn due to the difference in investigations. I also learned, after asking them how this could happen, even if they had stolen my information from somewhere else, since Navy Federal has a secret verbal password in order to complete anything. So how did someone know what my verbal password was considering that is not something they can steal from anywhere else, and I was informed that Navy Federal had done away with the need to use the verbal password. I told them, that verbal password could've been the one thing that kept my money safe. I then asked them if they had contacted the authorities in that area where the money was stolen, and I was told that they do not do that, and that if I wanted the authorities contacted, I would have to do it myself. Now, I have never had this happen, so I had unfortunately assumed, that a bank would call the authorities to ensure this doesn't happen at whatever branch it happened in, but I was wrong. So I began my research into what authorities to contact since I reside in XXXX XXXX, CA, the fraud took place in two different states quite far from me, and I didn't know who's jurisdiction this would belong to. A friend of mine that is a police officer in a different city of California, recommended I contact my local sheriff station and speak to them regarding the situation. I went ahead and filed an incident report with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I let the bank know as well. I continued to keep in contact with the bank asking for updates, and asking if they had figured out how this could've happened, and the staff became ruder and ruder. This was all a very uncomfortable and scary situation from the beginning, and their treatment was very uncaring. I finally received a voicemail in XX/XX/XXXX, stating that my fraud claim for the {$9000.00} claim withdrawal had been denied and deemed my responsibility. I immediately called back and had another rough time trying to track down the woman that had called. Once I was connected to the security/fraud department they verbally told me the same thing. I asked what evidence their decision was based on since I was in XXXX, California when all of the transactions took place. The security lady informed me that due to the fact that the individual used my pin to make the withdrawal that proved that it was me. I verbally disputed this, and informed the lady that I was personally made aware of the fact that someone had walked into that branch shortly before making that withdrawal and was given a new debit card and pin, which is why they had a pin. And that if she looked in the history of it all she would clearly see that. She stated that the decision had been made and that they would not be reopening the claim. She asked if I would like to see the evidence and surveillance that they had proving it was me, and I said yes. She then proceeded to tell me that she would need a subpoena. I was very upset when this happened and told there I wanted to speak to someone else. She told me I could file a dispute on the claim. I called back and asked how I could file a dispute, again, I was treated very poorly and even brought that to their attention. No one would give me the name of the lady that had handled my case, the name if the individual that made the decision on it, or even the file number. They thought I simple wanted to complain about one individual when in reality I was trying to dispute the decision because I had evidence that I was in California the day of the fraudulent activities took place and I needed who to forward everything to. The whole situation was very frustrating and mentally and emotionally draining. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received the denial letter for the {$9000.00} claim as confirmation that it was indeed denied. 
Luckily, on the day the fraud occurred, XX/XX/2019, I was caught on camera in XXXX, CA, on multiple phones due to having a going away luncheon for a colleague at our work office, and I was also caught on my jiu jitsu instructors camera while I was on the phone with the fraud department at the gym. I have contacted an attorney as I feel that my continued pursuits to try to correct this with the security/fraud department will lead nowhere. I do would prefer not to move forth with litigation, but I need my money back! As a new realtor, I am technically self-employed, worked my butt off for that money and still have to pay taxes on all that money that my bank allowed to walk out of the bank branch. It is ludicrous! Where is my protection as a, multiple year, loyal member of that credit union?! It is absurd how easily these people could just walk in and steal my money from my bank IN PERSON. Absolutely makes me afraid to bank ever again! 
The only individuals that treated me with exceptional care, was the initial lady I spoke to, the one that gave me all the details that took place that day, and the very last gentleman by the name of XXXX, that was trying help me figure out how to get things sent to the right person, and although we didn't exactly find anyone concrete, and he found me a general address, he was so kind to me, that I actually broke down crying because FINALLY someone with some compassion for the true victim.

I'm complaining about a series of mistakes made by Fulton Bank which are preventing access to my money. 

I opened an account with Fulton Bank in XXXX of XXXX. I opened the account with a deposit of {$150.00}, made {$5.00} in debit card purchases, and earned a {$25.00} bonus for a total of {$170.00}. The balance remained at {$170.00} until XXXX. 

I logged in a few weeks ago to close the account and noticed there was over {$2000.00} in it. I determined that someone else had somehow used my account number to link with their XXXX account, and passed verification, evidenced by two small < {$1.00} "" verification '' transactions in XX/XX/XXXX. There were many deposits and a few withdrawals. 

I called in, and this is when the unpleasantness began. 

I said I simply want my {$170.00} and don't care about the rest. They said they have to start an investigation. They made me go to a branch on XX/XX/XXXX to sign about 20 forms, one each for the transactions that weren't mine. They said they would get back to me within 24 hours. At that time, I asked if I could withdraw {$170.00} and they said I could not. 

Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I got a call asking me to go to a branch and sign the dispute forms. I said not only did I sign them already, I have photocopies, so what are you talking about. The caller seemed confused, then apologetic. That's when I decided I needed to make a complaint. Fulton Bank has been holding on to my money, even knowing that A ) I want it back B ) I'm being 100 % honest about the rest of the money which isn't mine and C ) I have done everything they asked me to do promptly. 

I'm very upset that not only have they allowed improper access to my account, but they have lost the paperwork I went out of my way to sign, and on top of all that are preventing me from accessing my own money. 

I feel like I am being punished for doing the right thing. I can think of multiple other ways I could have handled this situation that would have allowed me immediate access to my money and far fewer headaches and I am very upset with Fulton Bank. 

You may also want to investigate XXXX and how they allowed the account to be "" verified. '' Did the other person have access to my bank account? Did they guess correctly? ( 1/1000 chance ) Does XXXX actually ignore that test when allowing linking? Either way I want my money back and I want it ASAP.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,FULTON FINANCIAL CORPORATION,MD,208XX,None,Consent provided,Web,6/16/2020,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3701479

Again, I do not look or touch this savings account as it is not connected to my checking or any other account. The fraud department agreed and realized it was fraud. We went through every transaction over the phone for over an hour. I was leaving for vacation that day and was told to go to my branch when I returned to sign documents.

I decided to call XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX to figure out if the account can be traced and figure out how I can receive my money.

I went through every transaction on the phone originally. At the date the bank reported to XXXX, XXXX shut down the fraudulent XXXX account. They explained to me that they allow 6 months to dispute a charge and would have reimbursed all charges when it was reported.

I asked him why teller walked away out of sight with a large sum of CASH? Why she didnt count it in front of me? And stated that Ive never seen this happen at any bank branch before. And how can I confirm she made a proper deposit?

They were fine when I put money in but I learned when you try to take your money out they hold your money hostage! 
In XX/XX/XXXX I deposited $ XXXX in my chase account. I had just sold my home in XXXX and was moving back to my home in XXXX. 
Mr.XXXX  XXXX was my long time fund manager who when asked to close out my investment portfolio would no longer speak with me ( but he effectively did close out my accounts ) and said Mr. XXXX XXXX will take care of your banking accounts from here on in. 
Mr. XXXX was happy to put the funds in for me in XX/XX/XXXX and repeatedly said you do not have to withdraw these funds. He instructed me to leave the money in Chase bank because Chase has parent companies in XXXX in which I would be able to freely access my money as if I were still at his branch. Well it soon became apparent that this was not the case at all. 
I had called Mr. XXXX on a number of occasions to transfer funds to my account in XXXX but sadly to no avail. I had to enlist the help of a friend to call the bank and merge conference calls between us in order to effectively make a transfer to my account in XXXX. He now knew I was not alone. I also have a problem not hearing very well and I believe he did not have the patience for me. 
I had made several attempts with the help of my friend XXXX going forward but he would say he is no longer my Chase private client and said Mr. XXXX will now be in charge of my account. When asked who the branch manager was I was told a man by the name of XXXX and would not release a last name. I had trouble ever being able to effectively make a transfer going forward. I did this with the help of my friend who can also verify the surreal behavior of the employees at this branch. It was inhumane to say the least. I certainly was not treated as a Chase Private Client with this behavior. 
I also want to note Mr. XXXX even lied and said he was not in but the next day we found out he was in. He hung up the telephone on me and when I would call back there were simply no way to reach him. 
I was left to call an 800 # which the branch always suggested I do ; so they wouldn't have to bother with me. This 800 # was very difficult for me as I am hearing impaired. 
I again enlisted the help of my friend XXXX who can attest to how easy they can reject your transfer with not answering on time or entering my pin # in a quick amount of time. 
It was very frustrating to say the least. 
However, I finally with the help of my friend had gotten a wonderful customer service representative through the 800 # who was patient and we successfully had a transfer confirmed from my account at Chase to my bank account in XXXX. I had gotten a Wire Transfer Receipt ( attached ) confirming on XX/XX/XXXX my funds would be available at my bank in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Firstly, the woman handling this transfer did say that they had to contact the bank for them to ok it??? We both explained how awful this branch is and that they have been holding my funds Hostage for all this time! 
On XX/XX/XXXX we again called the 800 # to find that the transfer was "" Cancelled ''. The girl XXXX was very helpful and emailed Mr. XXXX with instructions to call both myself and my friend XXXX who was helping me through this transaction. It took 2 hours on the phone. My XXXX  was called at XXXX by XXXX to please call XXXX and all calls were left unanswered and I never did receive the transfer.

We sat down and the ONLY Financial Advice, Planning, Maintenance, or Assistance, the Acting Store Manager/Assistant Store Manager, did was to tell me to take {$20000.00} to pay off my home and that would put {$250.00} in my pocket each month. '' I told her "" That sounds good, but I'm not sure if that's what I should do right away, as I would like to speak with an investor, to see what's the best options, and to make sure I don't squander or lose my money, as there may not be an opportunity for us to have this kind of check again. '' She Told me, well here is a card, and she wrote a number on the back of her business card, and she said you can call this number and somebody should be able to help you. 
And she said now let me open you the "" Stellar Saving Account '' and you will be good to go. 

I sat there sad, and all slumped over, and I was confused, as I was beyond excited to have received that kind of check, and the check had just arrived by Express Delivery that morning, as I was able to settle my case, by myself, out of court, after four ( 4 ) lawyers told me that I wouldn't get anything for my case. 

To settle my own XXXX XXXX case, I worked with the XXXX XXXX XXXX Office, and also picked up medical records from another provider, and I researched Florida Statutes, and I was able to prove additional injuries and that the insurance carrier had not properly handled my case, and the Insurance Carrier chose to settle out of court, and I legally and rightfully received the full uninsured/underinsured motorist policy of the {$100000.00}. 

So, the Employee that was in both Employment Capacities, Acting Store Manager/Assistant Store Manager, proceeded to open my "" Stellar Savings Account '' and did absolutely NOTHING else even that day to assist me with my Financial Planning and Investments, of my assets, or to even open other accounts, to diversify the money, as she could have helped me open "" CD 's '' or "" IRA 's '' or even an additional savings account for my Son, but she did NOTHING else to manage, and assist me, for my son and I, and our future.. 

She handed me the information, on the "" Stellar Savings Account ' and the entire time, I knew I was making a horrific mistake, "" trusting '' the "" advice '' of the Employee that I knew in a Fiduciary Capacity, as she just sat smirking and smiling and all thrilled and happy that I had "" opened '' a "" new '' "" Stellar Savings Account. '' During the enrollment process, and the "" conversion '' of my money from My Intended and Planned purpose to merely deposit my XXXX XXXX Settlement Check into my already existing Checking Account so that I could go to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, in a few days, and invest my money, the Acting Store Manager/Assistant Store Manager, asked if I wanted to keep the information online, or keep the account to have mailed bank statements. We discussed about the size of the deposit, and so with her advice, as well, I chose to NOT have my "" Stellar Savings Account '' online. 

The choice to stay offline, ended up being a really bad choice, overall, as the lapse in time in bank statements, and other personal matters, including my own health issues, and that my brother was fighting XXXX XXXX, and very sadly did transition, and that I was very busy filing, what ended up being three ( 3 ) separate Federal Court Cases, all during the time frame, I was "" exploited '' and "" ripped off '' of what I say is, thousands of dollars of my money, what I believe was stolen by the TD Bank Employees, including the Acting Store Manager/Assistant Store Manger. 

I also fully believe that the Acting Store/Manager/Assistant Store Manager May have received a "" bonus '' or "" perk '' or "" raise '' or some sort of benefit to herself, by pretty much "" forcing '' me to open the "" new '' "" Stellar Savings Account '' So, while I was busy on 1200 pages of documents over a year and a half, in the three ( 3 ) Federal Court Cases, and fighting through being sick, and even injured, and dealing with family and their sickness, between XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I was going to the TD Bank Store Location that opened my "" Stellar Savings Account '', and I would get cash, but I kept telling the various Bank Tellers, including the Acting Store Manger/Assistant Store Manager, that "" opened '' the "" Stellar Savings Account '' that "" I felt that my balances were wrong, and that I was going through my money too quickly, and that I needed to get with an investor, or do something so I wouldn't lose all of my money. '' They even know that I was paying additional mortgage payments, to bring down the principal on my home, but they did NOTHING to Assist me, help me, guide me, or even direct me to any of the other TD Bank actual Brokerage Investment Subsidiaries, of TD Bank, such as TD Ameritrade or the TD Bank Investment Management Offices. 

Instead, from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I was "" deprived '' of my "" ownership interest in my financial assets for the future, for my son and I '', in "" trusting '' the Fiduciary Confidence and Advice of the Acting Store Manager/Assistant Store Manager, who to me "" represented '' herself, as a "" Broker '' and her TD Branch Store Location, as an "" Investment Brokerage. '' I met with the Acting Store Manager/Assistant Store Manger in XXXX of XXXX, and asked her "" Where is all of my Money? '' and "" Why am I broke? '' The Acting Store Manager/Assistant Store Manager, printed out all of the bank statements, and threw them at me, and told me, "" You spent all of your money. '' I was sad, and XXXX, and crying and I told her, that "" I didn't think it was right, what happened to me, and that I didn't have any money left for my son and I, and our Future. and that I wanted an "" investigation '' into my account, as there were Thousands of Dollars, that I could NOT Account for in any of my records. '' The Acting Store Manager/Assistant Store Manager did NOTHING. 

In XXXX of XXXX, I contacted the TD Regional Branch Manager, and advised of what occurred, and that I felt I had been "" Exploited '' and "" Ripped Off '' as a XXXX Adult in Florida, and that I wanted my {$100000.00} back, as I feel that the Acting Store Manger/Assistant Store Manger, had no Legal Right or Capacity, to tell me to NOT Take my check to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and to "" force '' me to "" open a "" New '' "" Stellar Savings Account '' and that they completely misrepresented themselves, as a "" Broker '' and their TD Bank Store Location, as an "" Investment Brokerage, '' and I kept claiming that Money was going out of my "" Stellar Savings Account '' faster than I could account for in my receipts or records. 

The TD Bank Regional Branch Manager did NOTHING. 

So, in XXXX of XXXX, I once again, contacted the TD Bank Regional Branch Manger, and advised of the Violations of Florida Statutes 812, Theft, Robbery and Related Crimes, specifically, Chapter 812.014 ( 1 ), ( a ), ( b ) and ( 2 ) ( a ) ( 1 ), and that the Acting Store Manager/Assistant Store Manager had ""  converted '' my money, by "" grabbing '' my check, and then "" forcing '' me to "" open '' a "" new '' "" Stellar Savings Account, '' and as such, I was "" deprived '' from my "" intended '' "" plan '' and "" goal '' to "" invest '' my "" ownership interest '' in my XXXX XXXX Settlement Monies and Assets, of the {$100000.00}, with XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. I further advised the TD Bank Regional Manager that TD Bank is a Commercial Bank, and does NOT meet the same legal authority, point or purpose as an ""  Investment Brokerage, '' such as XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. 

Additionally, I also advised TD Bank that they have Violated Florida Statutes Chapter 825, Exploitation of a XXXX Adult, specifically, Florida Statutes 825.105 "" Good Faith Assistance '' in that the Acting Store Manager/Assistant Store Manager, took advantage of me, and "" exploited '' me and BOUND TD Bank to me as an "" Investment Brokerage '' firm and company, when the Acting Store Manager/Assistant Store Manger "" opened '' the "" Stellar Savings Account '' that they would be "" brokering '' my "" financial assets and resources, for the future. '' The TD Bank Regional Branch Manager responded to my letter by sending me copies of my Bank Statements, and Copies of the Savings & CD Withdrawal Slips. 

Within days, I responded to the TD Bank Regional Bank Manager, that I was again, Demanding Full Settlement, of My {$100000.00}, XXXX XXXX Settlement Assets and Resources, as out of the Fifty-Four ( 54 ) Official TD Bank Savings & CD Withdrawal Slips ( "" Slips '' ), at least Thirty-Five ( 35 ) of the Slips, have been Altered, have Mistakes, Have Errors, are Missing Information, or are Incomplete and the other Nineteen ( 19 ) slips, even though they appear to be complete, they also seem to be missing information or have altered information. 

1. Many of the 35 Slips, do NOT have the completed Written Dollar Amount to verify the Actual Numerical Cash Withdrawal amount. 

2. And there is a Savings & Withdrawal Slip where the WRITTEN AMOUNT says TWENTY FIVE and the DOLLAR AMOUNT says {$2500.00}! There is QUITE a DIFFERENCE Between {$25.00} Dollars and {$2500.00} Dollars. 

Additionally, there are Savings & CD Cash Withdrawal Slips where it looks like a number 1 has been added to a Prior Slip, that was a {$400.00} dollar withdrawal became a {$1400.00} Withdrawal and a {$700.00} Dollar withdrawal looks like it became {$1700.00} Cash Withdrawal Slip. 

And a NUMBER of the SLIPS LOOK like there are EXTRA SPACES by the NUMERICAL NUMBERS where they should be closer together, like someone may have Photocopied a Larger withdrawal Slip and then Whited Out and/or Changed, REUSED, and FORGED the withdrawal slip, to have a different dollar amount. 

And Some of the Slips the Numerical Number is Changed, but there is NO WRITTEN DOLLAR amount to Verify the Withdrawal amount. 

3. Some Savings and CD Cash Withdrawal Slips ( Slips ) have My name spelled wrong, as XXXX or just my last name XXXX with a scribble at the end. And additionally, some of the Slips Looked Copied Over as my signature looks exactly the same 4. Some Slips have Employee Initials 5. Some  Slips do NOT have Employee Initials 6. Some Slips have Multiple Employee Initials with some written over or altered 7. Some Slips have NO DATE, and other slips have Errors on the Date, with some Slips missing the Year and/or part of the date is written over 8. Some Slips have Errors on the Account Numbers and they have been written over, changed or altered 9. And there appears to be a number of XXXX initials, as many as 15 of them, yet, I don't know a TD Bank Employee that works at the TD Bank Store Location, with those initials. 

However, I do know from being a TD Bank Client, the former teller XXXX, whom I happened to see at the grocery store a number of months ago, was one of the main tellers that had access to my "" Stellar Savings Account '', during the time frame the majority of my cash came up "" missing '' or "" unaccountable '' and then she either quit, or was fired, as she was criminally charged for, I believe it was, Scheming to defraud ' as I saw her mugshot in the local crime report for being arrested in the spring of XXXX. 

I further advised the TD Bank Regional Bank Manager that because the Acting Store Manager/Assistant Store Manager is in Violation of Florida Statutes Chapter 812 Theft and/or for "" Conversion '' of my "" ownership interest '' in my {$100000.00} XXXX XXXX Settlement and also in Violation of Florida Statutes Chapter 825 Exploitation of a XXXX Adult in Florida, for failing to have "" Good Faith Assistance '' with regard to the "" pre-existing '' "" fiduciary relationship '' and failed to assist me, with maintaining my financial stability, assets and resources for my son and I, for our future. 

I also then further advised the TD Bank Regional Manager that since the Acting Store Manager/Assistant Store Manager is in Violation of Florida Statutes Chapters 812 and Chapters 825, I am allowed to file "" Pre-Settlement Notice '' of Violation of Florida Statutes Chapter 772, Civil  Remedies for Criminal Practices, I would then be entitled to "" three fold actual damages, or treble damages. '' I am seeking reimbursement of all {$100000.00} of my XXXX XXXX Settlement Monies, along with the treble damages for a Total Demand Settlement of {$300000.00}, as the Acting Store Manager/Assistant Store Manager, whom had a "" pre-existing '' "" Fiduciary Relationship '' had no legal Right or Capacity to tell me to NOT take my check to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and then to "" convert '' my funds to her TD Bank Commercial Bank and to "" exploit '' me of my financial assets and resources, to what may even be her personal gain or benefit, without any assistance, or maintenance to me, as a XXXX person under the Laws of the State of Florida. 

I requested for the TD Bank Regional Branch Manager to Settle with me, out of court, to avoid the attorney 's fees, and costs of filing litigation in this matter. 

The TD Bank Regional Branch Manger, declined to settle out of court. 

I already outlined the Threefold or Treble Damages, under Florida Chapter 772.11 ( 1 ), and I am in the process of preparing another Demand for Settlement Letter, which will further comply with the "" Pre-suit '' Requirements of Florida Statutes Chapter 772.11 ( 1 ). 

Additionally, I sent an email on XX/XX/XXXX, to the TD Bank Regional Manager, as TD Bank, is also guilty of Violating Florida Statutes Chapter 655, Title XXXVIII, Banks and Banking, and specifically, Chapter 655.50, the "" Florida Control of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing in  Financial Institutions Act, '' and specifically Chapter 655.50 ( 8 ) ( a ) which states, in part, the following : ( 8 ) Each financial institution shall maintain : ( a ) Full and complete records of all financial transactions, including all records required by 31 C.F.R. parts 500-598 and 1010 for a minimum of 5 calendar years.

Additionally, I sent the TD Bank Regional Branch Manager correspondence with the Email that  outlined the additional Violations of Florida Statutes According to the Florida Statute Chapter 655.50 Florida Control of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing in Financial Institution Act, specifically, Statute 655.50 ( 4 ), states the following with regard to the within State Statute Requirement, to have a BSA/AML Compliance Officer that is Required to comply with the rules and regulations within Chapter 655 and all of the other Bank and Financial Institution Rules, Regulations and Statutes on both the State and Federal levels, ( emphasis added ) : ( 4 ) A financial institution shall designate and retain a BSA/AML compliance officer. The board of directors of a financial institution must ensure that the designated compliance officer is properly qualified and has sufficient authority and resources to  administer an effective BSA/AML compliance program. The board is ultimately responsible for establishing the institutions BSA/AML policies and overall BSA/AML compliance. A change in the BSA/AML compliance officer must be reported to the office.

In addition, Florida Statute Chapter 655.50 Florida Control of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing in Financial Institution Act, specifically, Statute 655.50 ( 3 ) states the following Requirements for the Bank Secrecy Act ( BSA ) / Anti-money Laundering ( AML ) Compliance Officer in accordance with the additional the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 ( BSA ), the USA Patriot Act of 2001
and all of the other Federal and State Banking and Financial Institution Statutes, Laws, Rules and Regulations, ( emphasis added ) : ( 3 ) As used in this section, the term : ( a ) BSA/AML compliance officer means the financial institutions officer responsible for the development and implementation of the financial institutions policies and procedures for complying with the requirements of this section relating to anti-money laundering ( AML ), and the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 ( BSA ), Pub. L. No. 91-508, as amended ; the USA Patriot Act of 2001, Pub. L. No. 107-56, as amended, and federal and state rules and regulations adopted thereunder ; and 31 C.F.R. Parts 500-598, relating to the regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC ) of the United States Department of the Treasury.

Therefore, TD Bank, is Required to have a BSA/AML Compliance Officer that is fully responsible for complying with Florida Chapter 655, Title XXXVIII, Banks and Banking Rules and Regulations. And also for complying with all of the other Federal and State Banking and Financial Institution Statutes, Laws, Rules and Regulations with regard to keeping Full and Complete Records of All Financial Transactions. 

So, TD Bank is also therefore out of compliance then with the Federal Banking Rules and Regulations with regard to Full and Complete Records of All Transactions and also the Federal Anti-money- Laundering laws. 

Once again, I made demand to TD Bank for a fair, reasonable and equitable settlement under the Chapter 655 Title XXXVIII, Banks and Banking, Chapter 655, Financial Institutions Generally, of the 2019, Florida Statutes, under Chapter 655.50 Florida Control of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing in Financial Institutions Act, specifically 655.50 ( 3 ) ( a ), ( 4 ) and ( 8 ) ( a ), as well as Florida Statute 812 Theft, Robbery and other Related Crimes, and Chapter 825 Exploitation of Elderly Persons of Disabled Adults in the State of Florida and also pursuant to Chapter 772.11 ( 1 ) Civil Remedies for Civil Practices for FULL DEMAND of {$100000.00} x THREE ( Treble Damages ) for FULL DEMAND SETTLEMENT of {$300000.00}.

On XX/XX/19 I contacted Bank of America at XXXX. The customer service representative stated that they had no record of the accounts and I was to contact Unclaimed Property at unclaimed.org which I did.

In addition, because I am in need of the fund, the situation forced me to take a new loan which costs me interest/transaction fee. 

Other customers with similar complaints can be found here ( and also in XXXX  website ) : XXXX : XXXX? XXXX https : XXXX Update as of XX/XX/XXXX : I have made a complaint through XXXX  ( Complaint ID : XXXX ), and the responses from Citi have been very unprofessional and unsatisfactory : 1. The first response was to extend the response deadline for another 14 days.

2. The second response referred me to their original letter and instructions, which I clearly followed until I reached a dead end. This shows that they did not read the original complaint.

This seems like a fraud at two different levels : FALSE ADVERTISING and WRONGFUL ASSET FREEZING. Was the sign-on bonus jus
t a way for Citi to lure customers into putting money in their account, just to freeze it with no proper communication to the customers and with no proper process ( it has been 30+ days since the fund was blocked.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",MA,None,None,Consent provided,Web,3/25/2020,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3579933

914,2020-12-05 00:00:00,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Fee problem,"Several years back, I started to have problems with Citizens Bank. 

First off, I keep money in banks as liquid emergency funds for various expenses, foreseen and unforeseen. 

The interest rates are negligible, so, I don't pay much attention to the accounts - they are there, if and when I need them. 

I started to notice that a particular account was decreasing in value. 

Upon inquiry, I was told that the bank was now charging a fee for paper statements that are mailed to me. 

I stopped having paper documents mailed to my home. 

Also, anytime I came in to open an account or a CD, I was forced either to get a debit card as well, in the case of opening a new account ; or, a new account when I wanted to open a CD. 

On one of these occasions when I was opening a new CD I was told to open an account, and, I opted to have no paper statements mailed to the home, since I knew from the previous incident that I would be charged. 

We have accounts in two other banks and are not charged for these services. 

Similar coercive and misleading practices have sparked investigations against other banks. 

Some time went by and someone from my branch gave me a call to inform me that I have been charged {$25.00} a month, for 18 months, due to my account being "" dormant ''. 

I have never been compelled to interact with my accounts at other banks - I didn't even know that such a stipulation existed. 

After pleading my case with the branch manager 6 months of fees were restored to my account on XX/XX/2020. 

However, this is unacceptable. 

In my opinion, this bank has basically stolen {$300.00} out of my account. 

One of the employees said that she was trying to reach me concerning this matter but she never left a message. 

I keep my phone off the hook because I am plagued by unwanted robo calls. 

I just happened to have the phone on the hook because I was expecting an important call when the phone rang. When I answered, it was the representative from Citizens Bank. 

So, I have representatives not leaving messages and I can not read statements that show the ongoing penalty. 

I realize that I was able to read the statements on line but I refrain from that practice because my computer system is old and susceptible to security risk. 
Security breaches have already happened on several occasions. 

I don't do anything on line - I don't even pay utilities or credit card bills on line. 

I only use the Internet for commerce in limited situations when purchasing something at XXXX or XXXX that I can not easily get at a local store. 

I don't believe that Citizens Bank had the right to deduct and take away this money from my account. 

This money belongs to me, and, this would be a non-issue if they didn't force me to open the account in the first place. 

I have taken financial hits during the Covid-19 pandemic and I really need every XXXX of my own money. 

I contacted Citizens Bank on Friday, XX/XX/2020, concerning this matter. 
They told me that they would have someone contact me by the end of business day the following Tuesday. 

For three days I kept my phone on the hook but did not receive a phone call from Citizens Bank, just solicitation from other sources. 

Can you please help and investigate this matter so that I can have my money restored?

I have never lived in Arizona. I do not currently live in Arizona. I have never stepped foot in Arizona. The representative started a claim for us ( claim number can be provided upon request ), and the phone call ended. ( Phone call screenshot has been taken to prove call was made and at what time ) On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a letter in the mail stating that our claim has been denied, for the reasons that 1.

I told the representative that these are not sufficient justifications to denied that fraud took place. The document we received states that my bank card was used as identification in this transaction, not my ID. Additionally, neither I nor my husband have ever been to Arizona. I can even provide my passport to show that I have never been anywhere outside my State. And finally, a signature could be forged. The representative then informed me that 2 forms of State IDs were used as verification of my transaction in the claims file. I informed her nowhere does it say that on the document I received. It clearly states that my BANK CARD was used as identification in this transaction. To which the representative said, "" well, the agent can not change what was already sent to you. '' Well, why would Wells Fargo send me inaccurate information as to why my claim was denied that would require further amendments in their claims system AFTER the denial document was sent to me? I advised the representative that I would need further proof as to why this claim was denied. I requested the information of the claims representative that worked on this claim, such as their name and contact information, to which the representative informed me that no such information can be provided. She then offered to note this conversation down in the claims file and request that the claims representative call me within 1-2 days. I agreed. 

Upon ending this call, I checked my bank account, only to find out that there is NO DISPUTES listed under this transaction. Nothing.

I recently noticed that I have been charged monthly maintenance fee ( {$5.00} ) since they made those changes. I called a representative on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about when they sent out these changes and a representative informed me that they would not have. The only way I would have been able to know about the fees was by looking at my monthly statements. Prior to the changes, I qualified for the waiver of such fees as I made the minimum monthly transfer ( {$25.00} ) from my checking account to savings. So to go from the fees being waived to not having any notices sent out to customers about the changes, I very annoyed. When I opened my checking and saving, I opened the two accounts linked together and inquired about how I could avoid these maintenance fees and I have made sure to maintain those features that would avoid paying them. Over two years - since XX/XX/XXXX - I have been charged these fees and did not receive any notice to inform me of the modifications they made to their structure. That is a total of {$130.00} in monthly fees that have been applied to my account. 

I spoke to another representative also on XX/XX/XXXX about my savings account, which when I opened was linked to my checking account. According to the new Regular Savings fee policy, one way to avoid the monthly fees was by having the Regular Savings linked to a Bank of America Interest Checking account, which I did have. But the other representative informed me that my savings account was not linked to my checking, which was not the case when I opened it.

She also had a plan for when I was to bring the bigger of my money over, in a couple of months times.For now, the plan was to do the minimal required to qualify for the promo bonus mailed specifically to me just like an invitation.I had to go through so much trouble, called running late and was told XXXX was not even in.I immediately felt troubled, as I am walking around with an {$18000.00}. check in my hands in downtown.I said that I am coming and getting this done because I was advised by XXXX to bring a check of at least {$15000.00}, ID., and that I didn't even need the promo.I wanted to get this check deposited immediately, safe & sound.I was  waiting for a bus, and told XXXX who answered at the bank, my phone provider has had problems and I can not waste minutes on the call but that I was just needing to let XXXX know that I was on my way to meet with her, as planned.I got a bad feeling with this XXXX over the phone, so proceeded but with reserve.Honestly, when you get that feeling with someone, BELIEVE IT. I showed up about half hour later, and XXXX was there no other costumers, sitting at a desk.She greeted me, and again BAD FEELING IN MY GUT. I have XXXX good intuition because as it turned out, she never had any intention of honoring the promotion I was specially given, but was eager to take my check!!!!!!!!! She asked for it suspiciously, just to ''look '' over it!!!!!! I have opened many of bank accounts in my day and the only time a check is asked for is when it's going into the account!!!!!!! She was extraordinarily false to me, telling me some story about how XXXX XXXX XXXX sold her mortgage from under her, all the while she is in cahoots to try and do ANYTHING into preventing me this bonus!!!! Total DEVIANT, SNEAK, CROOK. I would say CON also, but she never conned me, I had misgivings about her instantly over the phone not even having met her yet.She calls up some hidden people and plays her game, gives me this ridiculous ''sucker '' look and tells me the hidden players say we can't do it!!!!!!!!! For the trouble I went through alone, the decent thing to do would have been to honor the promo, especially when I am talking about bringing even MORE money in.It was them who called me to come in for an appointment in the first place, it was them who mailed me the invite, they not only thought nothing of wasting my time and causing me total distress, but then this XXXX puts on this act and says ''I 'm about to cry!!!! '', are these crooks out of their minds???? They pull a stunt like this and then claim THEY are the victim!!!!!!!!!! Then XXXX, butts in and threatens me with being escorted out of here!!!!!!!!! INSANE. The whole entire charade was orchestrated by them, there was never any intention of doing anything except swipe all my money. XXXX hung onto my mailing, and I had to fight for it back, and even obtaining names and corporate # was a theatrical joke. XXXX is scum for going along with XXXX XXXX mean-spirited ill-intentioned scheme, as I knew her making a phone call was just a way to weasel her way out of honoring something I met the requirements easily for. They claimed some nonsense about accounts not being closed a full six months, I have closed accounts only to discover they weren't & been charged fees on top of it.I specifically asked a teller at another branch if the account if closed, ''yes it's closed out '', only to find out they are very much still open & active.So they can keep fining the accounts I suppose. I told them that if I didn't meet the qualifications as a costumer, why was I mailed the invite?? Nobody else was mailed this, it's not a general mailer, not everybody has this amount of cash is why. I also insisted that I went through a lot of trouble to do all of this, and couldn't even get my money deposited into my other banks because now they are closed and I feel unsafe with this amount out of bank.They were beyond malicious & crooked, NASTY!!!!!!!!!!!! XXXX mentioned disrespect, what do you call what THEY are doing to me, ABUSE, PURE ABUSE RUNNING ME AROUND AND SCREWING WITH MY FUNDS & BEING FRAUDS. I am not allowed to REACT??????????????????? Where did COSTUMER RESPECT go????????????????????? They pull one nasty stunt like that and have the NERVE to mention ''disrespect '' because I react to it!!!!!!!!!!! I have enough experience in consumer law at this point, ( proudly I have never lost a dispute/claim, even with my credit cards which are difficult to win ), to know that what they were doing wasn't only devious and rotten, but probably not legal and certainly not moral and definitely NOT in the bank 's best interest. Which is why I am filing this complaint. Citizens Bank is now out a VERY valuable $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ costumer, because it employs ill & unstable, vindictive & corrupt individuals who clearly are BAD FOR BUSINESS and think they are  above the law and have zero obligation to stand by specific letters and mailings to certain costumers. I shouldn't be faulted, I did what was asked and went through a lot of trouble, and they were the ones who set this whole charade up!!!!!!!!

Unfortunately, my car insurance company was not so quick to turn over the account information and my monthly payment was deducted from the now checking account ending in XXXX.

I have been back and forth with them for the last month trying to figure out a solution to be able to access my hard earned money. I still have yet to receive a letter or any sort of explanation or reasoning as to why I can't access my account with my life savings.

On their website it claimed that they have a {$150.00} or {$200.00} bonus if you open the account and deposit the respective minimums within a certain time frame. 

I met all the requirements and waited for my bonus to show up on my account. After not showing up on my account for a few months I called their customer support team on XX/XX/XXXX and asked why I never received the bonus. 

I was told it was because I did not input the "" Promo Code '' for the offer which was pretty surprising to me because they advertised the bonus promotion on their OWN WEBSITE and on the same page that you click "" Open An Account ''. 

After taking a look at their website I noticed in very small print on the bottom of the page they explain you need to put in a promo code on the following page to receive the bonus. I explained to her that this was very deceptive and was clearly built to trick people into thinking they were going to get a bonus but never receive it on a technicality. Why should the customer have to enter anything extra when the promotion is advertised on the their own page that leads to the sign up page? This was all on discover.com and not a third party website. 

I was transferred to a supervisor by the name of XXXX and I explained to her the situation. She said that she could put in a claim with the "" Marketing Team '' and that since I met the requirements I should be able to get the bonus. She also agreed with me that it was very confusing the way it was setup and she could see how people would make that mistake. 

XXXX said in order to officially put in a claim I would need to provide her with the Promo Code and she would not be able to file a claim without a promo code. I laughed and explained to her that there is no way I would be able to retrieve a promo code that existed 3-4 months ago on their website. She kept saying that she could not file a claim without me providing her a promo code. 

After asking why multiple times- she said thats just the way it is on their system. This was very confusing and led me to believe this is also part of the deceptive behavior that Discover engages in. I told her I could look up a promo code online but it would not be the promo code that existed when I signed up since I obviously dont have access to that promo code anymore. 

She said it was fine and it should not impact the review process. I asked her multiple times to confirm that and she did. 

After receiving the mailed response weeks later it basically said they would not be able to honor the claim because the promo code I gave them did not match the dates. So I was rejected for the same reason XXXX said I would not be rejected for. Even though I met and surpassed the minimum requirements within the timeframe- they rejected it on another technicality that had nothing to do with the original bonus and offer. 

I put this on the back burner for a long time since I was busy with work. 

I called again the week of XX/XX/XXXX and was told the department I needed to reach was closed and they would get back to me. They left me a voicemail a couple days later and I called them back on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I spoke to another supervisor by the name of XXXX. I explained to him the situation and he gave me multiple reasons why they would not honor. When I explained the logic behind the reasoning was flawed, he had another angle to offer up. Which was also flawed. This went on for awhile until he finally said there was nothing he could do and it was all in the "" Marketing Departments '' hands. 

I asked to speak to the marketing department and he put me on hold. After several minutes he returned and told me there was no way for me to contact the marketing department over the phone or email and he could provide me with a mailing address to send a mailed letter to. I told him in XXXX its ridiculous that I cant talk to someone on the phone or email them and I felt like I was getting the run around. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX they still have the promotion on their website and it is still set up in this manner. 

To Summarize : - Discover Bank has set up a deceptive Bonus Offer on their own webpage that leads customers to believe they will receive a Bonus if they meet two guidelines which are to deposit a minimum amount of money within a certain timeframe of opening up the account.

- Customers later find out they did not receive the bonus due to not entering a code they were suppose to enter which is not very clear on their website and is designed on purpose to mislead. 
- Their customer support team is trained to give you multiple reasons why they cant honor it and set you up in a matter as to reject your claim via mail and hope you give up. 
- Discover Bank uses a deceptive bonus offer and manipulative customer support to trick people into signing up for Savings Accounts and never deliver on their Bonus Reward.",None,DISCOVER BANK,IL,None,None,Consent provided,Web,5/19/2020,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3659767

994,2/22/2020,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Opening an account,Didn't receive terms that were advertised,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I saw an offer online that said the following : "" Open a new eligible checking and savings account in the Citi Priority Account Package during the offer period XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 

Maintain a minimum balance of {$50000.00} between the checking and savings accounts for 60 consecutive calendar days. 

After all required activities are met, the {$600.00} bonus will be deposited to your account within 90 calendar days! '' The www.citi.com/rates page also showed that their savings account would earn a 2.36 % interest rate as well. The only other stipulation shown was that the {$50000.00} minimum balance needed to come from "" New-to-Citibank '' funds. So I opened a new Interest Checking account # XXXX as well as a new Citi Savings account # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and transferred {$50000.00} from my XXXX XXXX XXXX account to provide the new-to-Citibank funds. 

I never received any ATM debit or credit cards nor any way to access my account online. Anytime I would call Citibank, I was given multiple reasons as to why I could not access my account online such as there was a "" block on my account '' for no known reason as stated in a call I made on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told the reason the {$600.00} bonus was never deposited into my account was due to this "" block. '' Another call on XX/XX/XXXX was when I learned that on XX/XX/XXXX they had removed the block on my account, but still the {$600.00} bonus was never deposited. 

I then received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that the reason I would NOT be receiving the {$600.00} bonus was because I was a previous Citibank customer, and the offer is only for "" new-to-Citibank customers. '' This was not what the offer I saw online and applied to stated. Also, during calls with Citibank I was informed that the 2.36 % interest rate is only good for certain customers in locations without any local branches, while another time I was told an entirely different story that the 2.36 % interest rate is a separate offer than the {$600.00} account open bonus and you can not receive both. 

So when I told Citibank I wanted to have my money transferred back OUT of their accounts and have the accounts closed, I was told that I had to do that online - that they could not do it over the phone. And yet they also said I could not access my accounts online since they had made the error of never sending me any debit or credit card in the first place. I was able tonight to log-into my XXXX XXXX XXXX   account, connect it to my Citi savings account, and initiate a funds transfer OUT of Citi and back into my XXXX XXXX  account instead.

This rule is against the human rights of a person. How can they close my account without my permission. 
I am very sorry to say that some of USA rules definitely help criminals like my husband. It is very pathetic to say that my husband never shown me my complete SSN No. He kept my SSN in his locker under his own custody.

As per Wells Fargo letter my husband has been added to my account in XXXX XXXX XXXX without my approval. where as in enclosures attached by Wells Fargo it is noticed that my husband produced the documents for change of relation ship in XXXXXXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX.

"" Q : What changes has the Board implemented to savings deposits in response to COVID-19? 
Posted : XX/XX/2020 A : On XX/XX/XXXX, the Board announced an interim final rule to amend Regulation D ( Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions ) to delete the six-per-month limit on convenient transfers from the savings deposit definition. The Board took this action in light of the elimination of reserve requirements on all transaction accounts, making the retention of a regulatory distinction in Regulation D between reservable transaction accounts and non reservable savings deposits unnecessary. In addition, financial disruptions arising in connection with COVID-19 have caused many depositors to have a more urgent need for access to their funds by remote means, particularly in light of the closure of many depository institution branches and other in-person facilities. The interim final rule was intended to allow depository institution customers more convenient access to their funds and to simplify account administration for depository institutions.

It was handled through XXXX and deposited into a Wells Fargo client account. Wells Fargos Fraud Department has thus far refused to reimburse XXXX XXXX for their clients fraudulent withdrawal of funds from my Dads account.

( He is supported by the Connecticut Services for the XXXX. ) When he informs me there is a problem, we go to the bank to take care of it. Unfortunately, it may not be immediately addressed and he does not have access to online banking. I live a couple of towns away and am there every week or two.

Dad informed me in XXXX that there was a shortage of several thousand dollars in his XXXX XXXX XXXX  Savings account. The fraudulent charges occurred between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. He would have received a paper bank statement several days into XXXX and 30 days into XXXX would have been the recommended timeline for a fraud claim. 

Peoples would not file a fraud claim until I contacted XXXX the intermediary between Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called XXXX and discussed the situation with an agent. He did a time investigation and discovered that it appeared to be an account at Wells Fargo that accepted the money, but because of confidentiality he could not state who. He told me that it appeared to be fraudulent, and we should pursue a claim. That same day my Dad and I filed the Unauthorized Debit Transaction Form XX/XX/XXXX. 

This disputed transaction has been in the hands of Wells Fargo since XX/XX/XXXX. They have refused to pay the money that their accountholder illegally took from my parents savings account. As of XX/XX/XXXX they continue to contest this fraudulent XXXX Check from my parents Savings account.

After 63 days, they finally closed the account and returned my money. But no explanation was given even after multiple request to provide an explanation. 

Anyway during those 63 days, I lost hundreds of dollars because I needed to take a loan ( because my money was being used by Citi ). I lost another hundreds of dollars of not putting it in my other account that earnings MUCH higher interests. 

From my perspective, Citi stole my money for 63 days because they STILL failed to provide me an explanation of : ( 1 ) why the account was frozen, and ( 2 ) why my account was closed. 

Those 63 days may mean nothing for the company, but it meant lost of hundreds of dollars for my family and the Company is not owning responsibility for it.

I informed Citibank that I had never heard of XXXX XXXX much less had any commercial dealings with them nor had I ever given XXXX XXXX or any other person account information for my savings account or money market account nor ever authorized anyone to make any withdrawls from such accounts.

Finally on or about XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with Citibank and was told that the investigation had been concluded and they could not return the funds because I had authorized the withdrawls. This was completely false because as mentioned above, I had never dealt with XXXX XXXX, had never given anyone my savings account information or authorized anyone to make a withdrawl from such account, had never purchased any good or service remotely close to {$240000.00}.

I was told that I was entitled by law to obtain a copy of Citibank 's investigation file, which I did verbally and in writing ( see attached letter ).

After I waist my time doing all this the bank decide just to keep avoiding every time I ask for updates for my claim, the bank always give me bad attitude and bad customer service. I, as customer I just wanted an explanation why they declined my claim so fast with no explanation. Its been almost FIVE months and I havent heard from the bank at all. Its upsetting and disappointing because at the moment I open and account with Wells Fargo I never thought the bank would let someones else money just like that without notifying the client. They should have more security in their system. Its ridiculous the way they avoid their clients, I trust Wells Fargo with my money the least they can do is protect my money. How I said before its been 5 months and I have got zero respond from them this is my claim number : XXXX. I would like they to investigate this case more deep.

The account I was attempting to close had been opened with a minimum balance as a requirement of an auto loan that I have since paid off. Since opening, I have never overdrawn this account nor have there been any transactions in it. 

Although the transfer would have drawn the account down to {$0.00}, not a negative balance, the transfer was stopped for non-sufficient funds, and I was charged a {$29.00} fee for the returned ACH. On XXXX/XXXX/2020, I called Golden 1 customer service to request the erroneous fee be reversed, have my balance transferred to my primary checking account, and to have the Golden 1 account closed. I explained that the stoppage of the ACH was an error, since the ACH would not have overdrawn the account. The agent claimed that the fee was not an error on the part of Golden 1 and he was therefore unable to reverse it, although he was unable to explain how a non-negative balance constituted NSF. He also claimed there was no manager I could speak with to escalate the issue and explained that if I wanted to close the account, I would now need to deposit {$9.00} to cover the overdraft ( caused by Golden 1 unjustifiably stopping the ACH ) first, then I could request the account be closed.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"GOLDEN 1 CREDIT UNION, THE",CA,None,None,Consent provided,Web,2020-08-04 00:00:00,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3598622

But this event scared me, so I decided that I would do business with two banks moving some of my safety net cash to USAA.

So I became a member of USAA. I then created a savings account, applied for a credit card ( which was approved in minutes ) and noticed that their investment products looked good. I decided to rollover my 401k into USAA IRA and purchase a fixed income annuity. 
I had USAA electronically transfer XXXX from my XXXX XXXX  account. At this point I thought all was good. 
A couple days later I found that I had been locked out of my account. 
I called USAA and was told that I was suspected of some fraud and that they would do no business with me. 
The last representative I spoke with told me that she could not tell me what would become of my XXXX deposit. She told me that she could not tell me if I would ever get the money returned. She also said that there was no one else I could talk to and there was nothing else anyone could do about it. 
I have no idea what fraud they think I committed. Some have suggested that I triggered some reporting "" thing '' and that the money might have been turned over to the government ( IRS? ). I've read horror stories of this happening to people and people having to give up because they lack the resources to fight it. But my deposit was not cash, it was an electronic transfer triggered by USAA.

1047,6/17/2020,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"I am a XXXX year old woman but I am not dead. Yet Ally Bank, citing a "" public record '', gave "" deceased '' and "" inability to authenticate '' me as their reason for denying me access to my over {$100000.00} saving account for two months, from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/2020. 

It was only after a complaint to the CFPB that Ally broke their silence to confirm that this was why they would not speak or answer correspondence. It was also only then, on XX/XX/XXXX, that they announced I could finally access my funds. 

However, this response neither fully nor altogether truthfully addresses the issue : By XX/XX/XXXX Ally had full and incontestable proof that ( 1 ) I was alive and ( 2 ) the rightful claimant to the account. 

Why did they make no attempt to correct their monstrous error? Why instead did they wrongfully persist in ignoring me, dishonoring my withdrawal instructions and violating my rights as a depositor for an additional six stressful weeks? 

By XX/XX/XXXX they had received -- a copy of my current drivers license -- a copy of my most recent electricity bill -- a copy of the CD that matured XX/XX/XXXX which provided the money that they had permitted me to transfer to my savings account -- I verbally supplied correct answers to all personal and security questions on all occasions -- They had as well my addresses, physical and email ( long established and unchanged ), my telephone number, birthdate, beneficiary name, names of linked financial institutions ( including the one that presented my withdrawal instructions ). 

At any time they could, of course, have easily asked me for additional documentation. BUT THEY DID NOT. 

Initially they may have had a "" public record '' of someone's death but since they haven't disclosed any specifics despite my requests, I have no way of knowing if even that is true. Nonetheless, any such purported record would not, could not, match the facts in their own file about me -- my birthdate, address, even full name ; it could not have been anything other than plainly and irrefutably not mine and certainly not a credible excuse for questioning my existence. 

In short, once Ally knew I was not dead as well as that I obviously was the "" authenic '' account holder, they no longer had any legitimate reason for continuing to deny me my rights and for failing to perform their legal duty. 

Yet that's what they did. 

My lost interest ( what I would have earned over and above what the Ally account paid ) amounts to approximately {$270.00}. Ally breached our contract as of XX/XX/XXXX when they were also warned of consequential damages but continued to disregard their duties under the UCC.

Because there was no more incentives to keep the savings, I had them close the savings account number XXXX. I left {$25.00} in there to prevent any kind of overdraft.

1054,4/20/2020,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"CITI FREEZES MY ASSETS FOR 120 DAYS AND PROVIDED NO CLEAR EXPLANATION ( This is a DESPERATE CRY FOR HELP because I don't know what else to do.All attempts to resolve this with Citi came to dead ends. ) My family savings account has been frozen since XXXX. I was told by Citi that I could resolve it by calling the Fraud Department, but after making a lot of calls ( about 20 by now ) I was told the account is in "" review '' by the "" back office '' with no way to contact and that it is "" marked for closure ''. But none of them can tell me why nor provided a way to resolve it. I was told to wait for 30-60 days for them to contact me with the reason. 

In XXXX ( 60 days after the account was frozen ), I received a letter ( attached ) with cryptic message saying "" We periodically review customer accounts to assess the suitability of their banking relationship with Citibank. Pursuant to a recent review, it has been determined that we can no longer service your account ending XXXX  and your other related Citibank accounts. Based on this decision, we have taken steps to terminate your banking relationship ( s ) with Citibank. '' So after 60 days of locking my asset, Citi still does not provide clear explanation whatsoever as to why my account was locked and marked for closure. 

I made another call provided by the letter ( Fraud Prevention dept ) and was told ( again ) that the decision was made by the "" back office '' and that they do not take any calls. 

Worse yet, the letter says that the account closure will take up to 60 days. So basically Citi has no problem holding my money for 120 days but is unable to provide a sound explanation as to why. 

That is also 120 days of me unable to access my family 's savings that I really need especially during this time when businesses are closing and family 's are struggling. 

Because of this, I had to take a loan with high interest. 

I don't know what else to do here or who else to contact. We don't have a branch in my state. Citi Fraud Prevention is clueless. The "" back office '' is unreachable. Citi Executive Response Team is unable to help.
